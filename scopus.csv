Lengthy facts with technical terms, complex images, and explanations are among the reasons that make STEM subjects less desirable among the current generation and degrade the students’ learning experience. Students can be assisted with learning applications that are not only mobile but also integrated with features that are enjoyable to trigger students’ interest in STEM. Game elements and augmented reality (AR) are two technologies that are capable of improving students’ learning experience. However, there are limited guidelines for designing mobile learning applications that are based on game elements and AR. Moreover, the existing guidelines mostly focus on usability but not the overall learning experience. Therefore, this paper aims to design a model of a mobile learning application that integrates AR and game elements to improve the student learning experience. The model consists of three elements; content, pedagogy/technology, and interaction that was initially verified by the subject matter experts. A mobile application prototype called m-BioP was developed based on the model and tested heuristically. A complete version of m-BioP was evaluated in an experimental study with 30 respondents using the User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ). Respondents were biology students aged between 16 and 23 years that were recruited by purposive sampling. The results were positive on almost all features of m-BioP with values higher than 0.8 on the pragmatic and hedonic scale, thus approving the developed model. Based on the evaluation, the only aspect that requires improvement is the design of the videos. The model can be used by academicians and learning content creators as a guideline to design and develop mobile learning applications that are able to provide STEM students with a better learning experience. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.","Augmented reality; Game; Learning experience; Mobile application; STEM","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85160325758"

This research study aims to identify and evaluate effective pedagogical strategies and critical success factors (CSFs) that can enhance active learning among undergraduate construction and surveying students. Customized e-learning materials based on the Technology, Pedagogy, Content, and Knowledge (TPACK) framework were adopted to improve the learning outcomes and effectiveness for semester-long construction-related research course students. Subsequently, an institutional student-based questionnaire survey was conducted and analyzed using mean score, exploratory factor analysis, and fuzzy synthetic evaluation (FSE). Accordingly, the top five active instructional learning strategies are using examples to reinforce understanding, case studies to encourage critical thinking, videos to improve understanding, connecting course contents to current community events, and creating classroom versions of interactive games. Exploratory factor analysis classified the CSFs into five major factor categories. The FSE results indicated that the top three CSF categories enhancing students’ active learning include electronic tools as learning aids, complementary learning and feedback, and model learning system development.

Available definitions of video games do not account for the nuances of games used within education and have not been developed for that purpose. Several systematic reviews and meta-analyses have concluded that the lack of standardized definition is critically hampering a cohesive approach to research in this area. This article begins by reviewing the current scholarship on video game definitions and then suggests a definition for EVGs to improve research outcomes in the field. Given that the major potential of video game use in education is to improve learning, we advocate that educational research scholarship needs to develop a common foundational approach to defining EVG and associated educational technologies. We hope that this definition will advance the field by suggesting a common language and operationalization of EVGs. © The Author(s) 2023.","educational video games; game-based learning; serious games; video games","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85163650572"

Therefore, increasing environmental awareness and attitudes among the younger generation is very important. Natural and Social Sciences (IPAS) learning has a key role in achieving this goal. This study aims to determine the effect of the ecopedagogy approach in IPAS learning on improving the environmental attitudes of elementary school students. This study uses a quasi-experimental type with a Pretest-Posttest Nonequivalent Control Group design. The subjects of the study consisted of two classes, namely class IV Sina as the experimental class and IV Kahldun as the control class. This study was conducted at SD Islam Al Azhar 31 Yogyakarta. This study develops ecopedagogy-based learning media to improve students' environmental attitudes. Ecopedagogy emphasizes a balanced relationship between humans and nature. This learning media combines the concept of ecopedagogy in IPAS material, creating an immersive learning environment about the relationship between humans and nature. The research includes the development, testing, and evaluation of learning media, including videos, simulations, interactive games, and additional resources. Data analysis using paired sample ttest showed that ecopedagogy approach can improve students’ environmental awareness. The posttest results showed that the experimental class had higher scores compared to the control class, with an average N Gain value of 0.5207 indicating that the increase in environmental awareness of fourth grade students after using ecopedagogy-based media was in the “Quite Effective” category. © 2024, BPAS Publications.

The use of information and communication technologies in education is one of the fastest developing areas of research, but there is still a digital divide and a need for action in lifelong learning to empower older adults. Our aim was to understand the profile of older adults who use videogames and to identify the factors behind their use and their relationship with certain aspects of health and well-being (self-perceived health status, cognitive and physical functioning, psychological and social well-being). With this aim, we assessed the use and acceptance of different types of technology and how these might be influenced by different factors, such as older adults' age, gender and level of education. Results obtained suggest that there are significant differences between the frequency of video game use and age, gender, educational level and previous experience with digital technology, but no significant differences by gender were found in overall technology use. In conclusion, this study could contribute to the design of lifelong learning approaches for older people that can take advantage of the benefits offered by video games and other technologies to leave no one behind. © 2024 The European Association for the Advancement of the Social Sciences.","610800; digital transformation; information and communication technologies; lifelong learning; older adults; the future of societies; video games use","","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85198063861"

Newer methods of continuing education are needed to engage nurses in CGA education. Using multimedia and game-based applications in CGA education (CGA APP) may be an effective method for continuing education. Objectives: To test the effectiveness of CGA APP in improving nurses' confidence in their abilities to perform geriatric care. Design: A randomized, controlled trial were adopted. Setting: An 1343-bed tertiary-care medical center in southern Taiwan. Participants: A total of 1250 nurses met inclusion criteria in 35 adult wards. We employed stratified sampling to recruit a total of 132 nurses proportional to the number of nurses in each ward, from January to March 2019. Methods: Based on the Octalysis gamification framework, the CGA APP was developed. Participants were randomly assigned to either an CGA APP or a control group, which received traditional classroom learning of the same content. The main outcome was improvement in confidence in geriatric care ability were measured before and end of the training session, and six months later. Results: There were no differences in baseline characteristics (except years of experience as a registered nurse), knowledge, attitudes or confidence of geriatric care between the two groups. Clinical nurses in the CGA APP group demonstrated significantly higher confidence in their geriatric care abilities than control group immediately after the intervention (75.85 ± 10.71 vs. 65.93 ± 8.49, p < 0.001) and six-months later (71.13 ± 9.69 vs. 63.57 ± 8.78, p < 0.001). After using GEE to control the confounding variable, the CGA APP group remained significantly higher confidence in their geriatric care abilities than control group. Conclusions: Use of multimedia game-based applications my better engage and teach practicing clinical than traditional learning methods. Our findings suggest that such interventions be further developed and tested for a larger variety of continuing education needs. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Comprehensive geriatric assessment; Game-based; Multimedia; Nurses","Adult; Aged; Clinical Competence; Education, Nursing, Continuing; Female; Geriatric Assessment; Geriatric Nursing; Humans; Male; Multimedia; Taiwan; Video Games; adult; aged; clinical competence; controlled study; education; female; geriatric assessment; geriatric nursing; human; male; multimedia; nursing education; procedures; randomized controlled trial; Taiwan; video game","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85193829236"

The study was conducted for four months with pre-service teachers (n = 190) in an online Social Sciences course. The students were provided with the lesson plan and filled in an ad hoc questionnaire using a quasi-experimental design in an ecological environment. The results indicate a positive impact in all the assessed aspects after implementing the innovative experience. Utilizing a different teaching style, one with the student as the protagonist of the learning process plus the improvement of learning shows significantly positive educational results. These preliminary findings enhance the development of pre-service teacher training and a student-centered teaching–learning process.

Given the frequent interactions among teachers and students, not only teachers’ emotions but also peers’ emotions may influence students’ learning. This preregistered experimental study investigated how peers’ emotions (either enjoyment, neutral state, or frustration) affect students’ emotion, motivation, and cognition in observational learning of playing a science game. University students (N = 210) watched a video in which a peer model played a game and displayed either enjoyment, a neutral state, or frustration. The data were analyzed by random intercept cross-lagged panel models with Bayesian estimation and generalized orderrestricted information criterion approximation. We ran two set of analyses. In Analysis A, we used the peer emotion display that was intended as the condition variable, excluding participants who perceived a different emotion. In Analysis B, we used participants’ perception of the peer emotion as the condition variable. Both Analyses A and B revealed that students exposed to peers’ enjoyment reported higher enjoyment, relaxation, mastery-approach goals, and game performance, and lower frustration, anger, boredom, and mental effort than those exposed to peers’ frustration. We conclude that peers’ emotions affect students’ achievement emotions, mastery-approach goals, mental effort, and game performance differentially.

Still, very few studies focus on the teacher’s role. This study focuses on how a teacher acted in a learning-by-teaching activity with 20 children. In this small-scale field experiment, the teacher’s interactions and teaching actions were observed when the teacher scaffolded a learning activity where children played a collaborative digital mathematics game to strengthen their mathematical reasoning and conceptual understanding of arithmetic. When playing, the children were acting as tutors for a tutee, according to the learning-by-teaching principle. In one scenario, the tutee was a younger child; in the other, the tutee was a social robot. Twenty 30-minute game-playing sessions are observed, video-recorded, and transcribed. The study explores the teacher’s interactions and teaching actions in the two scenarios and discusses the results from the perspective of the teacher’s role, social norms, and teacher digital competence. The interaction and thematic analyses show similarities and characteristic differences in the teacher’s interaction patterns in the two scenarios. The teaching actions are similar on a structural level and differ regarding the types and distribution of teaching actions. In the child-child scenario, the teacher directs most teaching actions to both players, and the actions are didactic (mathematical) scaffolding. In contrast, in the child-robot scenario, the teacher only addresses the tutor, and the scaffolding is socially oriented. Implications for a teaching practice involving social robots as learning companions are discussed regarding teachers’ presence and participation, types of social robot knowledge that go beyond digital competence, and new challenges introduced by using social robots as learning companions in the classroom. The study contributes new insights into the teacher’s role and actions when teaching with a social robot in a collaborative learning situation, which is relevant for educational research and teaching practice. © The Author(s) 2024.","Embodied interaction; Game-based mathematics learning; Learning-by-teaching; Social robots; Teaching actions","","Article","Article in press","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85200843786"

According to research, esports may lead to cognitive, metacognitive, academic and professional competencies if appropriately supported (Adachi & Willoughby, 2013). However, there is no systematic curriculum or guidance on how to identify and support these competencies through esports training. Methods: This paper conducts a systematic review of literature from the learning sciences to provide a systematic rubric of competencies and instructional approaches to support them through esports training. The competencies that may be supported through esports are mapped along the game design principles as categorized along Mechanics, Dynamics, and Aesthetics (MDA) framework. Current training programs were analyzed to identify training approaches that can support these competencies across different contexts. Results: There is a wide range of cognitive, self-regulation, social, academic, and career competencies that were found to be supported through video games. However, the development of such competencies depend on the availability of the learning opportunities and appropriate support provided to engage these opportunities, thus requiring a systematic framework for esports training. The training approaches that can be implemented to support diverse competencies from esports training, whether amateur or professional, are varied in modality, style, and structure. Conclusion: The goal of this study is to inform the esports industry more largely, as well as the trainers, researchers, and designers with systematic and research-informed approaches to support future esports athletes, both professional and amateurs. Learning from the traditional field of athletic training, esports training should take more systematic approaches to design training curriculum and programs, as well as preparing the trainers. © The Author(s) 2023.","competencies; esports; learning sciences; systematic review; training","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85179715310"

This research focuses on evaluating the classic video game “” as an educational resource by future Early Childhood Education teachers. To this end, 261 Early Childhood Education degree students from the University of Córdoba (Spain) participated. Data collection was carried out through a specially designed questionnaire, which consisted of a Likert scale (1-5) with 16 items organized into three dimensions: Student/Gamer Profile, Quality of the Video Game, and Evaluation of the Video Game as an Educational Resource. The collected data were subjected to descriptive analysis, mean comparisons, and a study of correlations and linear regressions. The results indicate that future Early Childhood Education teachers have a low profile as video game players, adopting a neutral stance regarding the quality of this video game and its use as an educational resource. Ultimately, despite this indifference towards using this video game to promote learning among Early Childhood Education students, there was no rejection of it, making it feasible to use “Lemmings” to work on the contents of this educational stage. © (2023), (Emerson de Pietri).

Persistence through failure, albeit difficult to learn, is a skill that is valuable across many aspects of life. It may be useful to study how those who seek out challenging games understand and deal with failure, and how game design contributes to this experience. This study aimed to deepen the knowledge available using a qualitative methodology. Ten participants played the challenging platform game “Celeste” for a week before taking part in a 30 min semi-structured interview. Reflexive Thematic Analysis generated five primary themes: (1) Making Meaning of Failure, (2) Seeing Purpose in Failure, (3) Accepting Difficult Experiences, (4) Drawing Persistence from Design and (5) Differentiating Persistence in Life and Play. Results emphasize the centrality of goals and consequence in shaping player responses to failure, and outline that an encouraging, learning-focused game environment where failure is functional favours persistence. Challenge-readiness, striving for growth and mastery, analytical thinking, break-taking, involving friends in gameplay and self-efficacy also facilitated persistence, with the latter being transferred across the contexts of life and play. Directions for future research, implications for game design and suggestions for interventions targeting positive failure responses are discussed. © 2023 The Author(s)","Challenging video games; Failure; Failure responses; Game design; Persistence","Failure (mechanical); Human computer interaction; Interactive computer graphics; Challenging video game; Failure response; Game design; Game environment; Learn+; Persistence; Qualitative methodologies; Semi structured interviews; Thematic analysis; Video-games; Game design","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85179010072"

However, there is no analysis of the involvement of children in the development of video games promoting social science learning. The framework of the EU H2020 funded project “ALLINTERACT. Widening and diversifying citizen engagement in science” contributes to filling this gap by analysing the co-creation process between children, families, teachers, and researchers of a video game for children to distinguish between hoaxes and evidence to overcoming bullying. To this end, a 24-h Science Game Jam was recorded, which took place in a virtual space for group meetings in which five children, five family members, four teachers and four researchers participated in the co-creation of the video game and a collaborative document in the cloud including the guidelines of the video game, with their proposals for the development. Finally, they participated as well as in the co-creation of the video game itself. The key finding is that co-creation through an egalitarian dialogue, solidarity, and focus on scientific knowledge allowed these children to play a leading role in developing a video game where children of all educational stages learn to distinguish hoaxes and evidence in overcoming bullying. The involvement in science and the co-creation of science-based products benefited these children; as they were protagonists in science, they could express their concerns and the real problems they faced in their schools, which increased their scientific knowledge and strengthened their critical capacity about bullying. Furthermore, the adult participants also benefited from the knowledge provided by the children, especially in the development and creation of the video game. © 2024, The Author(s).","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85181228819"

Many researchers around the world have conducted studies to define CT, to develop CT in students, and to assess CT using various tools and paradigms. Our review focuses on the assessment aspect of CT using digital games. Typically, the assessment in CT is done using Multiple Choice Questions, Portfolio analysis, pen-and-paper methods, and games. The use of video games to assess CT skills was one of the least explored areas. To further explore this area, we did a systematic literature review on the use of video games to assess CT. The findings of our review are as follows: (1) CT skills such as abstraction, algorithmic thinking, data representation, debugging, decomposition, pattern recognition, recursive thinking, simulation, socialization, heuristic, iteration, and problem-solving were primarily assessed using digital games. (2) The reviewed articles used samples ranging from 18 to 3355 participants. (3) The sample includes elementary, middle-, and high-school and graduate students. (4) In the reviewed articles, it is observed that the time for treatment varied from a few hours to the entire school year. (5) A mixed-mode study using quantitative and qualitative methods was preferred by researchers to explore the CT aspects such as CT concepts, practices, and perspectives. (6) The use of video games, stealth assessment, educational data mining and machine learning for assessing CT skills is in a dormant state. (7) There is a lack of empirical evidence to prove that video games are effective to assess CT skills.

VR is expected to increase learners' agency because it allows for full-body interactivity from a first-person perspective, giving them novel ways of interacting with the digital environment. Yet, agency in immersive learning has not been well-studied relative to other affordances like presence, and more evidence is needed to understand how varied media and designs heighten or diminish agency. This mixed-method study addressed this need by developing and validating measures of sense of agency with 30 high school students who used VR field trips in their engineering class over four lessons. By comparing immersive videos to video game-like interactive graphical environments, the study illustrates some of the complexities of agency in VR. The findings indicate agency is not a unidimensional construct nor is it equivalent to full-body interactivity in VR as learners felt some types of agency when using immersive videos. Furthermore, learners' identities moderated associations between the type of VR media and their sense of agency, and agency did not change over time as the novelty of VR waned. These results suggest VR designers should consider varied ways of interacting in VR that are beneficial for learning. They also support the use of immersive videos when the educator's goal is to increase agency over learning or focus, and provide measures and direction for future research to assess the relationship between varied types of agency, features of VR experiences and learning outcomes. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Virtual reality (VR) can enhance learning by giving learners a strong sense of presence in the virtual environment and giving them agency over their learning through novel forms of interactivity. Many studies have looked at increasing the learner's presence in VR, but fewer have assessed learners' agency. Prior work found the impact of increased interactivity on learning was mixed: sometimes it increased learning outcomes and motivation, other times it did not. What this paper adds This study develops and validates measures of learners' sense of agency within VR learning environments. This study finds that more interactivity in VR increases how much agency learners feel over their actions but not necessarily their agency over learning and attention. This study also finds variation in students' experiences of agency based on their culturally defined sense of self-construal. Implications for practice and/or policy Practitioners interested in immersive learning technologies should consider the design of the media used rather than focusing only on the device's capability. Immersive videos may be effective tools for enhancing student agency, depending on the aims of the learning experience. Designers and educators should consider learners' identities such as self-construal, and understand student experiences may vary. © 2024 The Author(s).

This study establishes the Gaming and Literacy Education (GALE) Scale as a reliable and valid measure for examining literacy teachers' perspectives on digital games and learning. The GALE Scale is a 21-item five-factor model created by conducting an exploratory factor analysis with survey data from 516 literacy teachers in the central United States followed by a confirmatory factor analysis with data from another 516 teachers. While participants generally agreed that digital games can support student learning, they reported limited integration of games in their classrooms, and only 12.2% agreed they learned about game-based learning in their teacher preparation program. Given the efficacy of digital game-based learning across disciplines demonstrated in meta-analytic research, literacy teacher education and professional development on effective uses of games in literacy learning are warranted. Further, scholars can utilize the GALE Scale to examine teachers’ views on digital games and literacy learning across time and contexts. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","","Adversarial machine learning; Federated learning; Classroom practices; Digital game-based learning; Digital games; Digital-learning; Five-Factor Model; Literacy learning; Student learning; Teachers'; Teachers' views; Video-games; Contrastive Learning","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85203436811"

A control group, utilizing a non-interactive instructional video with the same content, was also established to contrast and evaluate the benefits of the game-based approach. The evaluation of knowledge acquisition and transfer was conducted through pattern tests, with the participants’ eye movements recorded during the testing process. The results show that the participants in the game group exhibited significant advantages in terms of efficiently recognizing fundamental content and effectively transferring pattern recognition. Furthermore, the examination of the visual behavior within the game reveals that the integration of the jigsaw puzzle (game mechanic) and scaffolding (instructional strategy) can enhance the efficacy and cognitive strategies employed by participants in comprehending heritage content.

The recent COVID-19 pandemic and the enforcement of movement control order (MCO) led to a significant increase in the regular engagement of young people with action video games, often through portable devices like smartphones. Owing to their widespread appeal, video games have significantly shaped contemporary society. Various elements contribute to aggression and violence. The potential impact on aggression, even if relatively small could be significant considering the substantial number of individuals participating in these action video games. The social learning theory, developed by Albert Bandura in 1965, was employed as the basis of this study. The main objective of this study was to examine the dimension of violent behaviour among diverse demographic backgrounds of young adolescents and to establish the relationship between this dimension and frequency of violent behaviour following action video game exposure. This study employed a quantitative research design using survey questionnaires. Purposive sampling was used to obtain data from 400 adolescents. The results reveal a noteworthy difference between school types and the dimension of violent behaviour (p < 0.05). Moreover, the study demonstrated a significant correlation between the frequency of violent behaviour and the dimension of violent behaviour, as indicated by Pearson correlation coefficient (r = .745, p < 0.05). These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the effect of action video games on adolescents, considering the rising popularity of video games in contemporary society. It is recommended that future research is conducted with a larger sample size to further explore and validate these findings. A combination of quantitative and qualitative research methods would allow for a more extensive exploration of the reasons behind some adolescents becoming violent after playing video games while others did not. Different situations and circumstances during gameplay could lead to diverse outcomes, and applying alternative methodologies and theories would offer a more comprehensive understanding of the complex relationship between video games and their effects on individuals, especially on their academic performance. © SEARCH Journal 2024.","action video games; adolescents; social learning theory; Video games genre; violent behaviour","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85204803600"

This conceptual replication investigated the short-term near transfer effect of playing Tetris on mental rotation abilities. The design of the conceptual replication was based on a comprehensive compilation of the methods used by previous literature on this topic and advanced in order to reach a high scientific state-of-the-art standard. We ran a high-powered conceptual replication study with 366 participants randomly assigned to either an experimental group playing Tetris or a control group playing Solitaire. Both groups completed three commonly used mental rotation tests in a pre- and a posttest session. Additionally, the experimental group played Tetris while the control group played Solitaire. Playing time was 10 hours in total within 4 weeks. Based on previous research, we hypothesized that this might generate a short-term transfer effect of Tetris on mental rotation. While participants showed a repeated testing effect for the mental rotation tests in both groups, we found evidence that Tetris does not produce a short-term transfer effect on mental rotation. Both gender and expected outcomes did not influence this effect.

A secondary aim was to assess the accuracy of VR games as a proxy for cognitive stimulation, specifically for attention. VR-based CSEs promise to improve attention and brain function through varied learning systems. Methods: This is a Phase 1 feasibility clinical trial at a single center. It involves 30 healthy volunteers randomly selected using the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classification system. Participants fall into ASA 1 (age >18–35 years, n = 15) or ASA 2 (age >60 years, n = 15) categories. All participants tested the ReCognitionVR-based CSEs. Feasibility criterion: Participants in each group were monitored for completion of 20 minutes of VR-based CSEs. Acceptability criterion: Proportion of participants with system usability scale (SUS) >35 or SUS score of 87.5. Safety (tolerability) monitoring: Sessions were monitored for neurological, cardiovascular, or pulmonary adverse events (AEs). Safety criterion: No more than 10% of sessions stopped due to neurological, cardiovascular, or pulmonary AEs. Results: The primary outcome (feasibility) of ReCognitionVR-based CSEs was 100%. For the secondary outcome (acceptability), there was no group difference in SUS scores (ASA 1 = 88.17 – 12.83 vs. ASA 2 = 88.39 – 10.22, P = 0.81). For the tertiary outcome (safety), mild transient uneasiness was reported by two (13.4%) ASA 1 participants (resolved in 2 minutes), and one (6.67%) ASA 1 participant experienced a temporary >20% increase in blood pressure from baseline. No ASA 2 participants had AEs. Conclusion: The feasibility, acceptability, and safety of ReCognitionVR-based CSEs in healthy elderly volunteers are acceptable, indicating that the evaluation of the ReCognitionVR-based CSEs in hospitalized patients is reasonable. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.","cognitive therapy; MeSH terms; video games; virtual system","","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85200921112"

These activities involve the integration of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics principles, fostering self-regulated learning, creativity, and innovation among students. The research encompassed the design of five STEM activity modules, including a UVC Box Experiment, Digital pH Meter, Air Sensor, Startup & Rare Earth Board Game, and Motion Sensor activity, which were shared with teacher interns via Google Classroom using tutorial videos, slides, and additional materials to enhance their skills. An examination of 26 lesson plans from 13 teacher interns was carried out through content analysis, within a learning model guided by High Impact Practices (HIPs) spanning six domains: well-structured lessons, project-based learning, reflection, learning progression framework, student-centered approach, and Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK). The results showed that the application of the DIY, Tinker, and Maker framework through STEM activities effectively improves teacher interns’ competencies in science instructional design and implementation. Particularly noteworthy was the gradual enhancement observed from the initial to the subsequent implementation across all HIPs domains, especially in showcasing TPACK. Nonetheless, the research also identified variations in competency levels, prompting contemplation among students. The importance of developing activities that stimulate student reflection emerged as a key point to consider. This indicates that STEM activities based on the concepts of DIY, Tinker, and Maker should emphasize such reflective practices.

We advance the notion of AlgoRitmo Literacies, to highlight the ingenuity of youth and educators as they used a tool called Character AI to author lore emerging within a virtual city called LiTT City. We conceptualize AlgoRitmo—a play on the word algorithm—as part inquiry and reflection (the algo or “something” of AI tools), and part action and future-oriented (ritmo as in movement). Inspired by cosmogonies influenced by Coyolxauhqui, the fragmented Aztec moon goddess, this paper illustrates how young people reconfigure AI artifacts, reshape relationships with AI-governed non-playable characters, and repurpose AI tools to envision alternative futures and identities. In identifying AlgoRitmo Literacies, we provide examples of how ChicanX communities subvert ideologies embedded in AI through creative and ingenious interventions in video games and the construction of cyborg Chicanx subjectivities.

CPSCoach 2.0 was developed and tested in the context of computer-mediated collaboration (video conferencing) with an educational game. It automatically analyzes users’ speech during a round of collaborative gameplay to provide personalized feedback and to select a target CPS skill for improvement. After multiple cycles of iterative testing and refinement, we tested CPSCoach 2.0 in a user study where 21 dyads (n = 42) completed four rounds of feedback and scaffolding embedded within five rounds of game-play in a single session. Using a quasi-experimental matching procedure, we found that the use of CPSCoach 2.0 was associated with improvement in CPS skill development compared to matched controls.

The present article investigates how these insights may be applied to mythological video games (i.e. those that represent and simulate a storyworld known from or inspired by mythological traditions). Specifically, this article argues (1) that through the collection, combination, and presentation of different myths, mythological video games often exhibit characteristics similar to ancient and modern mythography, (2) that on the basis of these mythographical qualities, they may be considered as interactive mythology museums, and (3) that the incorporation of these features has potential for applications in education. As case studies, this article considers the popular games Age of Mythology, Smite, Immortals Fenyx Rising, God of War (and its sequel, God of War: Ragnarök), Apotheon, and Hades in light of their mythographical and museal properties.

Adaptive scaffolding may improve performance and self-regulation during training by optimizing cognitive load. Informed by cognitive load theory, this study investigates whether adaptive scaffolding based on interaction trace data influences learning performance, self-regulation, cognitive load, test performance, and engagement in a medical emergency game. Methods: Sixty-two medical students from three Dutch universities played six game scenarios. They received either adaptive or nonadaptive scaffolding in a randomized double-blinded matched pairs yoked control design. During gameplay, we measured learning performance (accuracy, speed, systematicity), self-regulation (self-monitoring, help-seeking), and cognitive load. Test performance was assessed in a live scenario assessment at 2- and 6–12-week intervals. Engagement was measured after completing all game scenarios. Results: Surprisingly, the results unveiled no discernible differences between the groups experiencing adaptive and nonadaptive scaffolding. This finding is attributed to the unexpected alignment between the nonadaptive scaffolding and the needs of the participants in 64.9% of the scenarios, resulting in coincidentally tailored scaffolding. Exploratory analyses suggest that, compared to nontailored scaffolding, tailored scaffolding improved speed, reduced self-regulation, and lowered cognitive load. No differences in test performance or engagement were found. Discussion: Our results suggest adaptive scaffolding may enhance learning by optimizing cognitive load. These findings underscore the potential of adaptive scaffolding within GBL environments, cultivating a more tailored and effective learning experience. To leverage this potential effectively, researchers, educators, and developers are recommended to collaborate from the outset of designing adaptive GBL or computer-based simulation experiences. This collaborative approach facilitates the establishment of reliable performance indicators and enables the design of suitable, preferably real-time, scaffolding interventions. Future research should confirm the effects of adaptive scaffolding on self-regulation and learning, taking care to avoid unintended tailored scaffolding in the research design.

However, beyond offering interactive and engaging narratives, it is argued that these games play a vital role in CH. This work delves into the complexities inherent in representing history, archaeology, and CH within commercial VGs. It examines the portrayal of CH as a construct within these games, underscores the importance of collaborative efforts - between game developers, heritage professionals, and members of the communities represented - in their development, and highlights instances where commercial VGs can foster CH awareness. While many commercial VGs touch upon history and archaeology or embody diverse cultures as the platform for their narratives, the focus is placed on Shadow of the Tomb Raider to illustrate the many points found in this work because the game is said to ethically come close to representing the effects of archaeology on local populations and descendants of ancient people. The aim is to catalyze discussions among educators, researchers, game developers, heritage experts, and other stakeholders about the role of commercial VGs in enhancing learning and promoting consciousness about matters vital to cultural identities.  © 2024 the author(s), published by De Gruyter, Berlin/Boston 2024.","archaeology; cultural awareness; cultural heritage; history; serious games; video games","","Article","Article in press","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85202667087"

First-year physical education students (i.e., novice practitioners) were quasi-randomly assigned to three experimental conditions: continuous video, macro-segmented video, or micro-segmented video. Morning (between 08:00 and 09:00) and late afternoon (between 16:00 and 17:00) sessions were conducted, involving study phases (i.e., observation of the scenes of play) and immediate-recall tests (i.e., game comprehension test and game performance test). Oral temperature and mood states were also collected at the beginning of each session. Compared to the morning, the results revealed that afternoon hours resulted in higher oral temperature, higher negative mood states (e.g., anxiety and fatigue), and lower positive mood (i.e., vigor) in all experimental conditions. For both short-term learning tests, the results showed that: (i) students performed significantly better in the morning rather than in the late afternoon (regardless of video formats), (ii) students exposed to the two segmented videos performed better than those exposed to a continuous video at the two ToD (without any significant difference between macro-segmented and micro-segmented videos). The findings highlight the morning’s superiority in the acquisition of motor knowledge from different video formats, due to mood disturbances and lower arousal levels. The present experiment encourage basketball teachers to use segmented videos, especially in the morning, to explain tactical information for novices. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.","Basketball; Computer-assisted learning; Diurnal; Game actions; Instructional design; Short-term learning; Video","","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85200660508"

The study aims to consider the possibility and effectiveness of introducing the mobile game Lumosity: Brain Training into the learning process of first-year Philology students studying at Qiqihar University. Methods: The sample included 30 volunteers: 15 girls and 15 boys, whose average age was 18.4 years. Before the experiment start, the respondents took a pre-test based on the Critical Thinking Skills Success methodology, which was developed by the American scientist Starkey. It was stated that intensive one-month training with the use of the Lumosity premium application in the classroom would improve critical thinking skills. Results: The pre-test results showed that some respondents had had quite good critical thinking skills before the experiment as the average score was 22.13 out of 30 points. The effectiveness was evaluated using the Student’s t-test for paired samples. It is established that there are significant differences between standard and empirical values (p = 0.012). Conclusions: The research can be of interest to those who study the issue of integrating an interactive learning environment into university and student programs, as well as those who consider critical thinking as a field of scientific knowledge and seek to develop critical thinking skills. The novelty of the study is the fact that students were allowed to use the app only during classes, but the research hypothesis was confirmed. This indicates that an interactive learning environment can be considered as a tool for developing students’ critical thinking skills in the context of limited screen time. © The Author(s) 2024.","Critical thinking; Interactive learning environment; Mental efficiency; Mobile learning; Soft skills","Adolescent; Female; Humans; Male; Mobile Applications; Simulation Training; Students; Students, Nursing; Thinking; Video Games; article; autoregulation; cognitive rehabilitation; college student; critical thinking; female; human; knowledge; learning; learning environment; male; mobile learning; productivity; screen time; skill; adolescent; nursing student; procedures; psychology; simulation training; student; thinking; video game","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85187502488"

Although 'serious game' in education now seems synonymous with videogame, the effectiveness of hands-on traditional games to increase student performance that, besides, they also like is defended and proved. The proposal is not focused, as is usual, on a single aspect of the educational environment, but on integrating behavioral and affective aspects into the learning process. Background: The literature analysis shows the predominance of serious games based on videogames in education, perhaps due to the lack of objective evidence concerning the influence of traditional game alternatives, such as SHs, on students' attitude/learning. This objective evidence is addressed with a proposal to motivate and integrate the students, making them more participative and thus positively affect their learning. Intended Outcomes: The activity increases motivation (behavioral outcome) and socialization (affective outcome), boosting learning (competence outcome); besides, students like the activity. Application Design: The necessity for a different instructional strategy came from the lack of commitment by the students in the first year of Computer Science Engineering. So a game (they are entertaining and powerful tools to increase motivation) that takes the students outside their normal working environment (classroom and laboratory) was designed. The study follows a cross sectional design with experimental and control sets randomly created, and sizes of 106 and 98 students, respectively. Findings: Highly satisfactory and statistically significant results were achieved: their attitude in class and personal study was more active (motivation), new relationships were created (socialization), they obtained better marks (learning) and enjoyed the activity (user experience), even though it was nondigital.  © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Computer science (CS); educational research; engagement; motivation; serious games","Education computing; Serious games; Students; Activity-based; Computer science; Educational environment; Educational research; Engagement; High educations; Immersive; Learning process; Student performance; Video-games; Motivation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85185319063"

The political economy associated with video games and Bitcoin and Ethereum mining provided a staggering growth in performance and energy efficiency and this, in turn, fostered a change in the epistemological understanding of AI: from rules-based or symbolic AI towards the matrix multiplications underpinning connectionism, machine learning and neural nets. Combining a material political economy of markets with a material epistemology of science, the article shows that there is no clear-cut division between software and hardware, between instructions and tools, and between frameworks of thought and the material and economic conditions of possibility of thought itself. As the microchip shortage and the growing geopolitical relevance of the hardware and semiconductor supply chain come to the fore, the paper invites social scientists to engage more closely with the materialities and hardware architectures of ‘virtual’ algorithms and software. © The Author(s) 2023.","artificial intelligence; ASIC; blockchain; cryptocurrency; GPU; hardware; materiality; TPU","Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Computers; Knowledge; Software; algorithm; artificial intelligence; knowledge; software","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85165135256"

To conduct the study, the researchers employed a one-group pretest-posttest mixed-methods research design. A sample of 24 intermediate undergraduate engineering students from a private university in Chennai, India, participated in this study. During the experiment, the participants who enrolled in the course Interpersonal Listening Skills played the game Life is Strange 1: Episode 1 in the university’s language lab for four weeks. To collect quantitative data, all the participants took pre-and post-listening comprehension tests (LCT), and through close-ended questionnaires on students' perceptions using SPSS software, quantitative analysis of the data was made using frequency and percentage. And through the participants’ face-to-face interviews, qualitative data were collected and analyzed to gain deeper insights into the participants' experiences and perceptions. The post-test results revealed that participants' listening skills had improved in comparison to the pre-test results. Additionally, qualitative data showed that participants enjoyed playing the game and found it motivating, engaging, and an effective method to improve their listening skills. These findings were in line with those of several other studies. Thus, the study revealed that ESL learners' listening skills could be improved by playing the video game, which may have significant implications for ESL educators and researchers who can integrate DGBLL to improve language learning outcomes into their teaching and research. © 2024 ACADEMY PUBLICATION.","digital game-based language learning (DGBLL); English as a second language (ESL); listening skills","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85188711245"

In addition, some elements are uncommon within learning material, such as having a pedagogical agent as an opponent. To meet this gap, this article presents a pre-study (n = 150) and experiments (n = 98; n = 85) investigating the type of opponent (high versus low emotionally activating) and the perceived game difficulty (high versus low). Results indicate significant effects on perceived competence and attribution. In addition, the impact of emotional activation interacted with the individual gameplay experiences. However, effects regarding emotional activation could not be fully replicated, indicating an influence of the game-based scenario. In addition, it could be demonstrated that learning was not impaired, even though individual player behavior and performance during the learning phase differed significantly. Results are discussed regarding the optimal design of individualized learning material. Educational relevance and implications statement: The experimental series revealed that even the perception of difficulty – not the difficulty of the material itself – results in individual differences in player behavior, perceived competence, and attribution. It could be demonstrated that such individual game experiences can influence learning-related actions, such as playing more slowly and carefully, attributing more internally, and feeling more competent without actual differences within the content of the learning material. The importance of resulting perceived competence is further highlighted, as it could be demonstrated that it is an essential mediator for the emergence of positive emotional responses (i.e., feeling happy) after playing an educational video game. Overall, the results indicate the strong potential of adaptive digital Game-Based Learning scenarios, adjusting the gameplay experience toward an individualized and optimized path. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.","Adaptive difficulty; Digital game-based learning; Emotional design; Pedagogical agents; Serious games","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85186521271"

However, it is not clear whether similar advantages may be obtained even in virtual environments. Here, we investigate whether virtual interactions in a video game, similarly to real-life social interactions, may improve individuals’ performance in a subsequent implicit learning task. Twenty-one healthy participants were asked to play a cooperative video game for 20 minutes in three different gaming modalities: alone (Single-Player); together with someone without verbal interactions (Multi-Player -); and with someone with verbal interactions (Multi-Player +). After each gaming session, participants were presented with an EEG paradigm directed to measure mismatch negativity (MMN) responses, a well-validated index of implicit learning. MMN responses were significantly larger following Multi-Player +, as compared with Single-Player, and Multi-Player - conditions. No significant difference was found between Single-Player, and Multi-Player - conditions. These results indicate that implicit learning processes are enhanced following communicative virtual interactions. Verbal interaction in a virtual environment seems necessary to elicit social copresence and its positive effects on learning performances. This finding may have important implications for the design of virtual rehabilitation protocols and distance learning programs. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.","attention; learning; mismatch negativity; social interaction; video game","Adult; Electroencephalography; Female; Humans; Learning; Male; Social Interaction; User-Computer Interface; Video Games; Virtual Reality; Young Adult; adult; article; attention; distance learning; electroencephalogram; electroencephalography; female; human; human experiment; learning; male; mismatch negativity; normal human; rehabilitation protocol; social interaction; telerehabilitation; verbal behavior; video game; young adult; computer interface; physiology; procedures; psychology; virtual reality","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85196901557"

This issue has been exacerbated in modern times as substances (e.g., drugs and food) are becoming increasingly refined and tweaked to increase their addictive potential. Behavioral addictions have also come to the fore as advances in neuroscience have made it possible for companies to pinpoint and advertise “pain points” in society (e.g., physical and emotional pain, boredom, social comparison), offering distraction and escape as relief in various forms ranging from video games to social media. And in an age of relative abundance and availability, even food is engineered and designed for overconsumption, leading to overeating, overweight/obesity, and poor mental and physical health. Modern solutions (e.g., Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) have failed to adequately address our collective “bad” habits and addictions as overeating, anxiety, and addiction continue to increase. Over the past several decades, ancient Buddhist theories that directly target reinforcement learning have begun to be tested in research and clinical settings. In this commentary, I give a brief first-person historical account of the merging of Buddhist theory, clinical practice, and research that suggests that such approaches could offer more effective strategies for improving health outcomes compared to current treatment paradigms that focus on cognitive restructuring and willpower. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.","Addiction; Behavior change; Habit; Mindfulness; Reinforcement learning; Willpower","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85192818935"

Many people have invested in this field without adequate knowledge. Existing research has shown that using game design elements can be an effective method of education. Such learning interventions can potentially be a good match for educating market investors, as they provide risk-free simulations for novice investors to gain practical experience without having to be concerned about real financial losses. However, it is unclear how market investors perceive gamified and game-based learning interventions and whether they would adopt them for cryptocurrency education. Research Objectives: Our study investigated market investors’ perceptions, needs and expectations regarding the integration of gamification and game-based learning interventions in cryptocurrency education. Methodology: We conducted an online survey with n=413 participants, including experienced market investors and people who are interested in cryptocurrency. Within the survey, we presented the mock-ups of two cryptocurrency learning interventions: a gamified cryptocurrency learning application, and a cryptocurrency learning video game. Results: From market investors’ perspectives, our study revealed the benefits and drawbacks of incorporating gamification and game design principles to facilitate learning cryptocurrency.

However, there is limited knowledge about how existing games can effectively fulfill this role. This study compiled and analyzed 100 video games based on cultural heritage by adapting an existing framework that includes 10 game attributes for a comparative statistical analysis of the games’ engagement features. These features include narrative-driven gameplay, information capsules, task-driven learning, ease of play, identity-driven content, open-world exploration, people-centered perspectives, meaningfulness, simulation, and verisimilitude. The analysis revealed that while the majority of games adhered to most of the recommended attributes, features such as task-driven learning, open-world exploration, and simulation were either uncommon or rare. These findings highlight a significant opportunity to develop games that incorporate these underrepresented features, thereby providing more immersive and engaging experiences in heritage education. Furthermore, the study offers a systematic overview of existing games that represent cultural heritage, serving as a valuable resource for developers, designers, and educators in this field. © 2024 by the authors.","cultural heritage; digital game-based learning; gamification; heritage education; video games","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85191313626"

We present the work of three groups of undergraduate students in the Southeast United States (US) who were considered ready to take linear algebra. The students played the game Vector Unknown, reflected upon aspects of their gameplay using GeoGebra, and used that knowledge to design a level for a 3D version of the game under some constraints. We performed a grounded qualitative analysis of each student’s activity to identify key episodes of student reasoning about linear combinations using technology. Both authors reviewed the episodes and categorized them according to the type of student activity. We compared their reasoning in 2D and 3D space to understand how they made the transition and finally linked these episodes to the technology used to understand its role in building student understanding. We identify four forms of structuring space: Reasoning with Numeric Sums, Reasoning with Resultant Vectors, Reasoning with Tip-to-Tail Vectors, and Reasoning with Vectors as Points. We found that how the technology represented vectors and linear combinations influenced how students engaged in structuring space. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.","Dynamic geometry software; Game-based learning; Linear algebra; Linear combinations; Undergraduate mathematics","","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85202075006"

The quick advance of technology has also helped to introduce more powerful and sophisticated devices and digital applications in the classroom. As a result, gamifying a subject with serious video games is a new rising trend in the educational sector. Therefore, this research is based on the use of a serious video game that has been developed with institutional support and it aims to reinforce a university bachelor’s degree subject. The Engineer is a serious game designed to teach English for engineering and gives support to a textbook for the subject English B2 for Industrial Engineers at the Universitat Politècnica de València. This research aimed to measure the learners’ acquisition of new engineering vocabulary in English after using the game and the associated textbook. In our experiment, 64 Industrial Engineering degree students were divided into an experimental group that used the game and textbook and a control group that only used the textbook. Both groups took a pre-test and a posttest to measure their knowledge of general and specific engineering vocabulary. Results showed that the use of the serious game increased the exposure time to the foreign language, leading to better results among the experimental group. Students in the experimental group also showed more satisfaction with the course. The study concludes that serious games can be an effective tool for language learning and teaching as it extends the time of exposure to the new content and it also motivates the students due to its playful component. © 2024, Revista Educ.

The tool relies on a basis set formalism and can, therefore, explore any one-dimensional potential surface imaginable. This tool also lets students interact with the wave function and is the first of its kind to explore concepts such as the superposition principle and wave function collapse; its time-dependent nature shows how any wave function evolves over time, allowing for exploration of other concepts such as the uncertainty principle. The video game’s ease of use makes these concepts accessible to anyone, without prior chemistry or programming background─though we expect that it would be most useful for undergraduate physical chemistry students and instructors.

The paper also rationalises the need for the framework and presents the steps taken in its development. Design/methodology/approach: Initially, the background areas of SCDGBL and digital game-based learning (DGBL) are examined, and the need for a framework in digital educational game design that has a focus on SCL is then established. The rigorous and systematic design thinking process through which the framework was developed is then stepped through. The completed framework is then presented, and each section is detailed to explain its utilisation within the process of digital game design. Findings: The paper presents the completed student-centred experience (SCE) framework alongside a worked example of how it can be deployed in practice. Also included is guidance on the roles of the game designer and education practitioner at all stages of design, development and deployment and how they may contribute their experience during the game design process to create high-quality tools for learning. Research limitations/implications: While the SCE framework presented is complete, it is presented as a first version and will benefit from wider deployment and testing. Originality/value: This paper presents a new game design framework integrating existing knowledge on SCL and DGBL, which guides practitioners in the design of experiences that fully deliver the techniques of both areas. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Education; Video games","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85199989571"

Text and audio explanations are used by traditional museums to popularize historical knowledge and science for tourists, and general interactive systems are based on desktops. This learning method is relatively boring in terms of experience. As a result, tourists have no desire or interest in actively exploring and learning about bronze ware, so they only have a basic understanding about bronze ware. Since most tourists are familiar with games, they are more likely to be attracted by game content and will actively explore and interact with it. In addition, a certain degree of reality is created by virtual reality technology and an immersive experience through head-mounted devices is provided to users. In this paper, we take Chinese bronzes as the research objects. We first use 3D laser scanners to obtain bronze models ; then, we build a virtual museum environment, and we finally design a virtual reality curation game based on this bronze digital museum. This game offers visitors an immersive museum roaming and bronze ware interactive experience. Through a combination of text, video learning, and games, visitors’ curiosity and desire to explore bronze ware are stimulated, and their understanding and ability to remember bronze ware knowledge can be deepened. In terms of cultural heritage, this game is also conducive to the spread of traditional Chinese bronze culture throughout the world. © The Author(s) 2024.","Bronze ware; Cultural heritage; Digital museum; Game; Interactive design; Virtual reality","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85206194328"

However, the underlying mechanisms driving these cognitive modifications remain poorly understood. Objectives: This study investigates the fundamental mnemonic processes of spatial navigation, pattern separation, and recognition memory, closely associated with the hippocampus. Our objective is to elucidate the interaction of these cognitive processes and shed light on rehabilitation mechanisms that could inform the design of video games aimed at stimulating the hippocampus. Method: In this study, we assessed 48 young adults, including both video game players and non-players. We utilized virtual reality and cognitive tasks such as the Lobato Virtual Water Maze and the Mnemonic Similarity Task to evaluate their cognitive abilities. Results: Our key findings highlight that gamers exhibit heightened pattern separation abilities and demonstrate quicker and more accurate spatial learning, attributed to the cognitive stimulation induced by video games. Additionally, we uncovered a significant relationship between spatial memory, guided by environmental cues, and pattern separation, which serves as the foundation for more efficient spatial navigation. Conclusions: These results provide valuable insights into the cognitive impact of video games and offer potential for monitoring changes in rehabilitation processes and early signs of cognitive decline through virtual reality-based assessments. Ultimately, we propose that examining the relationships between cognitive processes represents an effective method for evaluating neurodegenerative conditions, offering new possibilities for early diagnosis and intervention. ª Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.","Gamer; Memory; Pattern Separation; Spatial Learning; Video Games; Virtual reality","","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85200558148"

This is necessary to understand students’ contributions in detail and to provide them with effective support in developing their multimodal skills. This study discusses the assessment of multimodal writing in English for Specific Purposes (ESP) contexts. It presents the design of an analytical tool for assessing multimodal texts and provided an example of its application. This tool covers assessment categories such as language use, content expression, interpersonal meaning, multimodality, and creativity and originality. As an example, we focus on the multimodal writing of a video game narrative, a genre that requires the integration of multiple modes of communication to convey meaning more effectively.

However, empirical support for this claim is limited. Most studies that analyze interactions associated to playfulness are correlational, which poses a problem for attributing differences to the degree of playfulness of activities. Aims: The present study sought to compare, in a controlled manner, the interactions and behaviors in prekindergarten and kindergarten classrooms during high- and low-playfulness activities. Sample: Participants were teachers, teacher aides, and 377 students in 12 classrooms (six prekindergarten and sic kindergarten) in six public schools from a low-income municipality in the capital city of a middle-income Latin American country. Methods: The behavior of children and teachers during high-playfulness and low-playfulness activities was videorecorded in two visits per classroom per game. High playfulness activities consisted of games designed by our team for this study. Videos were coded for proportion of on-task children, children exhibiting high levels of involvement, and teacher language (teaching, directiveness, warmth, humor). Data were analyzed using multilevel multiple regression to account for nesting in classrooms. Results: Children were more likely to be on-task and show high-involvement during high-playfulness activities than low-playfulness ones. Teaching and directive verbalizations were more likely during two of the low-playfulness activities, but not the rest. Responsivity and warmth were associated only with two of the games and in the opposite direction of our hypothesis. Teachers were more likely to produce humorous remarks during high-playfulness activities. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Child involvement; Classroom interactions; Early childhood education; On-task behavior; Playful learning; Teaching","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85194306576"

However, it is difficult to have an overall landscape of the scientific approach that has been carried out to date around this term. The objective of this study is to identify, analyze, and provide a comprehensive map of the emerging concepts published in the scientific literature related to game-based learning, as well as to establish the most studied topics around these concepts. Method: a search was conducted in the Web of Science (WOS) database for all articles related to this topic, and they were analyzed using both the title and keywords, as well as abstracts, through data mining techniques. The frequency of occurrence of unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams was calculated, as well as the investigated topics within the subject through latent Dirichlet analysis. Results: some of the most frequent unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams were: 'student', 'education', 'virtual reality', 'video game', 'learning environment', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'design methodology approach', and 'information communication technology'. From the model based on latent Dirichlet analysis, 15 research topics related to game-based pedagogy emerged, focusing on new tools for implementing gamification in different contexts (e.g., marketing or economics), as well as the application of game-based learning in the university environment to enhance learning and motivation, which have increased their scientific presence in recent years.

Narrative videos and virtual reality (VR) games have been applied in medical education, but their application in smoking cessation training is limited and understudied. Objectives: To evaluate the effect of smokers' narrative videos and mini-VR games on nursing students' empathy towards smokers (State Empathy Scale), confidence in practicing empathy, self-efficacy in smoking cessation counseling, and learning satisfaction. Design: An open-labeled randomized controlled trial, registration number: NCT05440877 (ClinicalTrials.gov). Setting and participants: Master of nursing students from the University in Hong Kong who enrolled in a smoking cessation course. Methods: All students attended a tutorial including case-based discussions and role-play. The intervention group could additionally access the narrative videos and mini-VR games of smokers' cases. Linear mixed models and Cohen's d were used to evaluate the intervention effect on the self-reported learning outcomes after the intervention. Results: 26 students enrolled in this trial, with 13 in each trial arm. All completed the trial. Post-test state empathy scores were significantly higher in the control group than in the intervention group (Cohen's d = 0.814, p = 0.049). No significant group differences were observed in the change of confidence in practicing empathy (β = −11.154, p = 0.073), self-efficacy (β = 4.846, p = 0.096), and students' learning satisfaction (Cohen's d = 0.041, p = 0.917). Both groups showed a significant increase in self-efficacy post-test (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Narrative videos showing smoking scenes and reluctance to quit, and our mini-VR games may weaken nursing students' empathy towards smokers. Smoking cessation training involving narrative videos should be modified. Debriefing and guidance to understand smokers' difficulties and express empathy are needed. VR games for smoking cessation training can involve more frame stories and challenging tasks to increase engagement. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Empathy; Nurse education; Nursing students; Self-efficacy; Smoking cessation","Adult; Counseling; Education, Nursing, Graduate; Empathy; Female; Hong Kong; Humans; Male; Narration; Self Efficacy; Smoking Cessation; Students, Nursing; Video Games; Video Recording; adult; article; controlled study; counseling; empathy; female; game; Hong Kong; human; learning; male; medical education; multicenter study; narrative; nurse; nursing; nursing education; nursing student; randomized controlled trial; satisfaction; self concept; smoking; smoking cessation; therapy; training; videorecording; virtual reality; education; nursing education; procedures; psychology; verbal communication; video game; videorecording","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85195255256"

This study developed a remote blended game-based learning activity that integrates digital game–based learning (DGBL) and blended learning (including online synchronous and asynchronous learning). This method emphasizes that in the online synchronous learning activity, students firstly use mini-educational digital games for group collaborative autonomous pre-learning and then take part in a problem-solving discussion activity guided by the teacher. Afterwards, students complete personal inquiry learning tasks in the asynchronous online activity and conduct asynchronous discussions. This study employed a quasi-experimental design. Participants were 73 senior high school students. The first group used the remote blended game-based learning that integrated DGBL into online synchronous learning. The second group used the face-to-face blended game-based learning approach that integrated DGBL into physical classroom learning. The third group used the remote blended video-based learning that integrated online synchronous video-based learning. The three groups conducted the same online asynchronous inquiry learning tasks. The results found that the remote blended game-based learning activity not only significantly promoted the students’ learning performance in online synchronous learning but also supported their learning performance in online asynchronous learning. Besides, most students’ discussion messages were mostly related to the learning tasks and topic. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.","Asynchronous; Blended learning; Collaborative learning; Digital game–based learning; Synchronous","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85191048351"

Students stated that learning tactics and strategy in soccer games is complicated and therefore difficult to understand because it uses conventional methods. Current developments have resulted in the acceleration of technology for learning in various conditions. This study aims to determine the learning outcomes of the twelfth grade students in senior high school by using animated videos based on problem-based learning in learning football games, especially in materials related to defensive patterns, attacking patterns, and football game formations. The method used in this study was experimental research using one group pre-test post-test design consists of 32 twelfth grade students (Male:12; Female:20). The learning process was evaluated using Formative Class Evaluation, and critical thinking skills were measured using critical thinking test instruments, The critical thinking assessment tool was evaluated by 4 experts. Result:This study showed significant differences in students’ critical thinking skills before and after applying problem-based learning animated videos [t=6.442; p= 0.000 (<0.05), with an increase of 14.65%. The achievement of student learning outcomes before implementing problem-based learning animated videos scored 66.66 in the poor category. After implementing problem-based learning animated videos, the score increased to 76.41 in the good category. Conclusion The application of animated videos based on problem-based learning in teaching and learning process helps students to theoretically understand football games with its complex tactics and strategies and to fully integrate their knowledge of defensive patterns, attacking patterns and formations in football games.

Individual differences significantly impact vocabulary learning, making it crucial to understand how these factors contribute to learning outcomes. Yet, previous reviews have mainly overlooked out-of-class exposure in their discussion of individual differences. The current review shows that the three factors can have a positive effect on lexical development. There are some points to consider such as the need for a large amount of input for outof-class exposure to be effective. Additionally, the review shows that both motivation and self-regulation are important for vocabulary learning and that they are positively related to vocabulary knowledge. It shows that more self-regulated and motivated students tend to have significantly larger and more developed vocabulary knowledge. By synthesizing findings from empirical studies on individual differences and vocabulary learning, this review provides insights into making vocabulary learning more effective. © 2024 Abdullah Albalawi.","individual differences; learning; review; vocabulary","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85205928255"

To address this need, we developed a serious computer game called the IEMTtraining game. In this game, players assume the roles of IEMT nurses, assess patient injuries in a virtual environment, and provide suitable treatment options. Methods: The design of this study is a retrospective comparative analysis. The research was conducted with 209 nurses in a hospital. The data collection process of this study was conducted at the 2019-2020 academic year. A retrospective comparative analysis was conducted on the pre-, post-, and final test scores of nurses in the IEMT. Additionally, a survey questionnaire was distributed to trainees to gather insights into teaching methods that were subsequently analyzed. Results: There was a significant difference in the overall test scores between the two groups, with the game group demonstrating superior performance compared to the control group (odds ratio = 1.363, p value = 0.010). The survey results indicated that the game group exhibited higher learning motivation scores and lower cognitive load compared with the lecture group. Conclusions: The IEMT training game developed by the instructor team is a promising and effective method for training nurses in disaster rescue within IEMTs. The game equips the trainees with the necessary skills and knowledge to respond effectively to emergencies. It is easily comprehended, enhances knowledge retention and motivation to learn, and reduces cognitive load. © The Author(s) 2024.","Gamification; Rescue work; Simulation training","Adult; Female; Humans; Male; Retrospective Studies; Role Playing; Surveys and Questionnaires; Video Games; adult; comparative study; female; human; male; questionnaire; retrospective study; role playing; video game","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85191068748"

This research was based at Tianshui Normal University in China. The authors examined the impact of an interactive learning environment based on artificial intelligence in the context of the preservation of important cognitive functions such as IQ as well as long-term and short-term memory. This research enrolled 539 s-year students. The experimental group (N = 322) consisted of students of the Faculty of Music, who have been studying music for more than one year using artificial intelligence technologies such as mobile applications, video games, music simulators, etc. The control group (N = 217) consisted of students of the Faculty of Arts, who never used the potential of the interactive educational environment during their studies. Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-IV) was chosen as the main method. The test results showed that students in the control and experimental groups averaged the same normal intelligence (97.61). At the same time, there was no significant intergroup difference on all four scales: verbal comprehension, perceptual thinking, working memory, and information processing speed (P ≥ 0.05).

The instructional design behind the incorporation of innovative technology and the use of game-based learning (GBL) could be a key to increasing student acquisition of science knowledge. Using a mixed methods design, this study examined the effects of a scaffolded Game-based Learning (GBL) science unit using a virtual reality (VR) game component. The VR game focused on the scientific method, lab safety, and equipment, and purposefully embedded instructional scaffolds to support the needs of diverse learners. The quasi-experimental study (pre- and post-test design) investigated the acquisition of targeted science knowledge with student groups of differing motivation levels and under two different game modes (immersive and non-immersive). With a mixed methods embedded design, quantitative data (student pre- and post-tests) was analyzed first followed by qualitative data (classroom video observations and student focus groups). Statistical analysis revealed: (1) students demonstrate an overall improvement on the post-test of targeted science knowledge in a scaffolded GBL learning design, (2) students using the immersive VR mode showed greater improvement in targeted science knowledge than students using the non-immersive desktop game, and (3) students with low intrinsic motivation performed better in the immersive VR than the desktop version. Further examination of qualitative data uncovered the GBL curricular activities and scaffolds may have also contributed to students’ science learning gains through reflection and discussion after gameplay experiences. The repeated multimodal learning opportunities and the opportunities to learn through whole-body movements were also found to be the potential reasons why the immersive VR group outperformed the non-immersive group. © Association for Educational Communications and Technology 2024.","Game-based learning; Learning motivation; Multimodal science learning; Scaffolding; Virtual reality","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85190688483"

Consequently, the importance of enhancing fire safety education for citizens has become more pronounced. However, due to safety risks in actual fire scenes, the practical use of firefighting equipment was often learned passively through text or video resources, posing challenges in ensuring users can proficiently operate actual equipment. Virtual reality (VR) emerged as a promising technology to provide users with a low-risk environment to gain hands-on experience with firefighting equipment. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the effectiveness of a specially designed VR game-based firefighting extinguishing equipment training (FEET) that integrated VR with serious gaming elements. The study evaluated the effectiveness of FEET through a comparison between high (HI) and low (LI) immersiveness VR and a non-immersive (NI) setting as a baseline. The study incorporated haptic feedback mechanisms, such as audio and vibration, to enhance user immersiveness within the HI setting. The focus of the study was on evaluating knowledge acquisition, user experiences, and interaction preferences for the proposed FEET design. The study adopted three distinct learning sequences to mitigate the VR halo effects. The results of the study indicated that both VR-based learning methods yielded outstanding user experiences that significantly surpassed the NI setting. Furthermore, the study showed that haptic feedback with richer game contents further enhanced user experiences, underscoring the importance of simulating realistic sensing in improving learning outcomes. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","education; Fire safety training; serious games; virtual reality","E-learning; Fire protection; Fires; Learning systems; Losses; Serious games; Equipment trainings; Fire safety; Fire safety training; Haptic feedbacks; Immersive; Immersiveness; Safety education; Safety training; Serious gaming; Users' experiences; Virtual reality","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85196628315"

Recently, novel approaches in technology-enabled learning utilizing virtual reality (VR) instead of traditional multimedia materials, digital learning games, and educational software. The use of VR technologies in language education improves creativity, interactivity, collaboration, problem-solving, and active knowledge building. In addition, the benefits of using VR in language education extend to lower elementary grades. Young learners can greatly benefit from the immersive and engaging nature of VR technology when learning English. By incorporating VR into English education, students in these grades can experience a more interactive and stimulating learning environment. This study examined which constructs affect students’ continuous use of VR by applying the Technology Acceptance Theory (TAM) theory and explored whether and how VR can improve students’ abilities to learn English compared to voice-video-based oral communications.

Data were obtained from a questionnaire answered by secondary school students aged 12–16 (N = 2015) regarding the different types and amounts of activities they perform in English outside school. Findings revealed that teenage learners were most frequently exposed to English through audiovisual input. Social media interaction, along with reading and writing (with or without digital support), were closely associated with their English marks. Other popular activities, such as listening to music or playing video games, were not found to be related to proficiency or even showed a negative correlation with it, while less popular activities, such as watching subtitled movies and series, could have greater potential for language learning.

This study draws on Erwin Goffman's (1974/86) analytical concept of framing. In particular, the analysis focuses on the instructor's and students' authentic conversations during a debriefing session and explores how these conversations open up negotiations of professional and playful learning. The research design is ethnographically informed and based on observations, field notes, and 34 h of video data from a navigation course in which 35 bachelor's students from a Norwegian university participated. Our analytical findings reveal that the activity undergoes continuous negotiation between two framings: professional and competitive. In professional framing, students are held accountable for adhering to professional rules, regulations, and norms of “good seamanship.” In the competition framing, students were competing to win the race. Moreover, as the competition mode intensified, students prioritized winning the race over adhering to the rules and regulations of the profession. Consequently, the findings illustrate how a competition framing within a professional education context has engaged the students, letting them demonstrate their knowledge and skills in a playful manner. Furthermore, the findings emphasize the need for an additional exploration of the opportunities and challenges of competition on professional decision making and ethical conduct in settings where simulation-based learning is utilized for training, particularly in domains that train students in high safety standards. © 2024 The Author(s)","Framing; Maritime Education and Training (MET); Playful learning; Professional learning; Simulation-based training; Video analysis","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85191791200"

GBA employs gameplay for learners to attain educational objectives while capturing data for analyzing their in-game competencies. The integration of gameplay in assessments has garnered increasing attention to GBA. This review of 21 studies provides an overview of the application of GBA in the field of education, covering aspects of the publication nature, theoretical frameworks, game types, in-game assessment details, and the assessed subjects and knowledge. Key findings include: (1) the annual number of publications fluctuates; a majority of studies originate from the USA; (2) the supporting theory tends to be unitary, with the evidence-centered design model cited the most; (3) simulation, immersive, and video games with rich game elements are applied most as assessment tools, and in-game assessment details are associated with game features; and (4) GBA is predominantly used in physics education. These findings indicate that applying GBA in education is promising with solid theoretical support, and practitioners are suggested to design GBA according to their educational needs and game features. © 2024 Hong Kong Bao Long Accounting And Secretarial Limited.

Building on a promising web-based serious game for reviewing and acquiring factual knowledge in dental education, the present study investigated the benefits of a dual-player mode and various game options for enhancing knowledge gain and study motivation. Methods: Before the intervention, students’ dental knowledge and game experience were assessed using a pre-knowledge test and questionnaire-based self-assessment. Students in the clinical study phase (n = 57) were stratified based on prior knowledge and gender and then randomly assigned to two groups, with two player modes: single player (SP) and dual player (DP). In the SP group, each participant played alone, whereas in the DP group, the participants played against a previously determined peer. For a period of 4 weeks, the students were able to playfully acquire knowledge from the field of operative dentistry using METIS, a serious game application with three different game options (Marathon, Sprint, and Time). After the intervention phase, both groups completed a post-knowledge test. The usability of the serious game was evaluated with a self-assessment questionnaire. Results: The competitive game mode (DP mode; M = 8.92, SD = 1.85) resulted in an increase in the factual knowledge test that was a mean of 2.49 points higher than the SP mode (M = 5.89, SD = 2.19; p < 0.001). The DP group also found the game significantly more helpful for learning (p = 0.04) and engaged more with the teaching content because of the app (p = 0.04). Overall, the usability of METIS was rated as excellent, and students successfully improved their knowledge of dentistry after game play with both game modes (SP, DP, p < 0.001), with the game option “Marathon,” which involves playing the largest number of questions, being the most preferred. Conclusions: These results suggest that serious games such as METIS are a suitable educational medium for increasing students’ knowledge and interest in the field, and that competition with peers provides even greater motivation to engage with the learning content. © The Author(s) 2024.","Competition; Dental education; Factual knowledge training; Serious game","Adult; Education, Dental; Educational Measurement; Female; Humans; Learning; Male; Motivation; Students, Dental; Surveys and Questionnaires; Video Games; Young Adult; adult; article; competition; competition game; dental education; dental student; dentistry; female; game; human; knowledge; learning; male; medical education; Metis; motivation; operative dentistry; questionnaire; self evaluation; student; teaching; training; controlled study; education; procedures; psychology; randomized controlled trial; video game; young adult","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85201691093"

Among these challenges is designing games to suit the goals of the educational process and respecting societal identity. Although there are many studies on educational video games, limited approaches that enhance teachers’ education have been explored. The current study focuses on stimulating pre-service teachers’ design thinking skills and improving the quality of their video games that have a visual identity by incorporating a design thinking approach into a makerspace. This study followed a quasi-experimental approach, in which 38 pre-service teachers from the departments of Art Education, Early Childhood Education, and Educational Technology at the College of Education at King Faisal University in Saudi Arabia participated. They designed and produced educational video games that consider visual identity and completed the design thinking scale. The results showed that there was great cooperation between participants from all disciplines in the work team, which affected the generation of creative and innovative ideas and the quality of the educational video games. This is due to the use of design thinking elements such as empathy, identification, ideation, and prototyping with different tools in the makerspace. This study calls for the use of a design thinking approach in the classroom learning space for teachers’ education, discusses implications for educational practices, and recommends further research in this area. © 2024 by the authors.","design thinking; educational video games; makerspace; product quality; Saudi Arabia; teacher education; visual identity","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85199622078"

However, there is limited research on SEL in informal learning contexts, including online sites such as gaming affinity spaces. Aim: This qualitative study aimed to investigate the social-emotional competencies demonstrated by players in a Reddit discussion board focused on Elden Ring, a video game known for its challenging difficulty. Methods: The study utilized theoretical qualitative thematic analysis on a focal thread at r/Eldenring. The thread had been upvoted over 18,000 times, included 2,363 comments encompassing 116,911 words, and had 997,765 readers when we extracted it for data analysis. Inductive codes were identified and grouped under preconceived themes based on the conceptual framework of the Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning (CASEL), which comprises five components: self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, relationship skills, and responsible decision-making. Findings: The analysis revealed promising social-emotional competencies demonstrated by players across all five components of the CASEL framework. Players exhibited self-awareness by reflecting on their emotions and self-management by regulating their frustration and persevering through challenges. Social awareness was displayed by showing empathy and encouragement towards others, relationship skills by offering support and advice to fellow players, and responsible decision-making by analyzing situations, solving problems, and reflecting on gameplay experiences. Conclusion: This study highlights the potential for informal SEL in gaming affinity spaces, as evidenced by players exhibiting social-emotional competencies during a Reddit discussion thread on Elden Ring. Future research should examine, among other aspects, the learning processes that facilitate the acquisition of social-emotional competencies in gaming affinity spaces and other informal learning environments, both online and offline. Additionally, special attention should be paid to the unique features of online platforms (like Reddit’s upvoting/downvoting) and their influence on users’ interactions and SEL. © The Author(s) 2023.","affinity spaces; emotional intelligence; informal learning; online communities; social-emotional learning; thematic analysis","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174255074"

Furthermore, serious games provide a context for training situations with unpredictable outcomes. Training these competencies is particularly important for healthcare professionals in emergency medicine. Methods: Based on these considerations, we designed, implemented, and evaluated a serious game in form of an emergency department, containing the features of a virtual patient generator, a chatbot for medical history taking with self-formulated questions, artificially generated faces based on an artificial intelligence algorithm, and feedback for students. The development process was based on an already existing framework resulting in an iterative procedure between development and evaluation. The serious game was evaluated using the System Usability Scale and the User Experience Questionnaire. Results: The System Usability Scale provided a substantial result for the usability. In terms of the user experience, four scales yielded positive results, whereas two scales yielded neutral results. Conclusion: The evaluation of both usability and user experience yielded overall positive results, while simultaneously identifying potential areas for improvement.

To do this, a narrative review was carried out through an advanced search with 140 articles of high scientific prestige between the period 2000 - 2023, selecting those articles that analyzed eSports in young people between the ages of 6 and 21. We proceed to conceptualize the term eSports and analyze its relationship with aggressiveness, gender, psychological consequences and the possibilities derived from its use and application in the educational environment. Regarding aggression in video games, we detected that young people with high levels of aggression can be attracted to violence in video games and that the correlation between video games and aggression can be caused by underlying variables. Regarding gender, the female presence is low, and men play weekly for longer. This gender gap is present in factors such as experience, performance, and gaming skills. Regarding the psychological consequences of using video games, we highlight that their use is associated with a higher level of intrapersonal skills, greater stress control and low interpersonal skills. Lastly, the educational implications that the use of video games generates in young people are analyzed, highlighting positive aspects such as the increase in meaningful learning or tolerance to frustration, and analyzing its negative aspects, since through violent content it can be generate negative affect leading to the appearance of alcohol consumption or aggression. Considering what is proposed, it is necessary to increase experimental, longitudinal, and correlational studies to clarify the behaviors and consequences of young players regarding the use of video games, which will allow the educational implications of digital technology to be more precisely defined. © 2024, Revista Educ.

Conventional instructional methods like video watching and lectures may not effectively meet professionals’ need for training programmes that are relevant to real-life. Digital game-based learning (DGBL) is a proven educational tool, yet its application in professional DfS training remains inadequately explored. This study examined DGBL's effectiveness using the SafeSim Design game to train construction professionals in DfS. A quasi-experiment was conducted to compare the effect of DGBL with that of online videos covering the same training contents. In total, 246 construction professionals participated in the course and 61 were interviewed or took part in a focus group discussion. We evaluated the change in pre- and post-course quiz scores, assignment scores, questionnaire responses, and qualitative data. We found that DGBL benefitted trainees more equally across different levels of prior experience. The results contribute to the literature by pointing out the importance of occupational background in influencing trainee performance, a factor not well explored in the literature. The results indicate that providing optional scaffolding support and detailed explanations for in-game activities is crucial, as this approach avoids the expertise reversal effect and helps manage trainees’ cognitive load. This study also demonstrated the feasibility of designing and implementing DGBL as an instructional tool for professional training. The above findings inform the development of effective DfS training and contribute to the wider implementation of DfS in construction industry around the world. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Construction safety; Design for Safety; Digital game-based learning; Expertise reversal effect; Professional training","Computer games; Construction; Curricula; E-learning; Professional aspects; Scaffolds; Construction professionals; Construction safety; Design for safety; Digital game-based learning; Expertise reversal effect; Instructional methods; Learning approach; Pressung; Professional training; Safety training; article; building industry; cognitive load; game; game-based learning; human; questionnaire; safety; training; videorecording; Construction industry","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85196295740"

Traditionally, metacognitive monitoring has been assessed through behavioural traces and verbalised instances. When learning in VR, learners are fully immersed in the learning environment, actively manipulating it based on affordances designed to support learning, offering insights into the relationship between physical interaction and metacognition. The study collected multimodal data from 15 participants, including think-aloud audio, bird's-eye view video recordings and physiological data. Metacognitive monitoring was analysed through qualitative coding of the think-aloud protocol, while movement was measured via optical flow analysis and cognitive load was assessed through heart rate variability analysis. The results revealed embodied metacognition by aligning the data to identify learners' physical states alongside their verbalised metacognition. The findings demonstrated a temporal interplay among cognitive load, metacognitive monitoring, and motion during VR-based learning. Specifically, cognitive load, indicated by the low- and high-frequency heart rate variability index, predicted instances of metacognitive monitoring, and monitoring predicted learners' motion while interacting with the VR environment. This study further provides future directions in understanding self-regulated learning processes during VR learning by utilizing multimodal data to inform real-time adaptive personalised support within these environments. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Immersive virtual reality (VR) environments have the potential to offer personalised support based on users' individual needs and characteristics. Self-regulated learning (SRL) involves learners monitoring their progress and strategically regulating their learning when needed. Multimodal data captured during VR learning, such as birds-eye-view video, screen recordings, physiological changes and verbalisations, can provide insights into learners' SRL processes and support needs. What this paper adds Provides insights into the embodied aspects of learners' metacognitive monitoring during learning in an immersive VR environment. Demonstrates how SRL processes can be captured via the collection and analysis of multimodal data, including think-aloud audio, bird's-eye view video recordings and physiological data, to capture metacognitive monitoring and movement during VR-based learning. Contributes to the understanding of the interplay between cognitive load, metacognitive monitoring, and motion in immersive VR learning. Implications for practice and/or policy Researchers and practitioners can use the causal relationships identified in this study to identify instances of SRL in an immersive VR setting. Educational technology developers can consider the integration of online measures, such as cognitive load and physiological arousal, into adaptive VR environments to enable real-time personalised support for learners based on their self-regulatory needs. © 2023 The Authors.

Hence, the purpose of this paper is twofold. Firstly, it presents preliminary work on the methodology for computing open passing lanes and derived metrics, integrating spatiotemporal data analysis with event data. Secondly, using a within-subject design, it investigates how modified handball games influence game play opportunities. Data were collected during handball matches in a pre-teens Physical Education (PE) class with mixed-skill-level teams. Game actions (e.g., passes, receptions, and shots) were manually recorded through systematic observation of video footage, while players’ positional data were captured with ultra-wideband technology. Findings provide evidence that employing a numerical advantage (one player up) enhances overall opportunities for individual attacking actions (i.e., more passing, catching actions, and goal-scoring opportunities) and relational actions (i.e., more open passing lanes) compared to equal numbers.

Research on the effects of combining these two strategies in nursing education is scarce. Objectives: To examine the effect of the combined use of gamification and AR in teaching mechanical ventilation (MV) on nurse students' knowledge, motivation, self-efficacy, and satisfaction. Design: Randomized controlled trial. Setting: A conveniently selected faculty of nursing in Egypt. Participants: A total of 410 nurse students. Methods: Participants were randomly assigned to the intervention or control group (205 in each). Kahoot games and AR were used in the intervention group, whereas a traditional lecture was applied in the control group. The outcomes included levels of students' knowledge, learning motivation, self-efficacy, and satisfaction. Results: Mixed design repeated-measures ANOVA test revealed a statistically significant difference in knowledge test scores within-subject over time (p-value [effect size]: <0.001 [0.515]), between-subject due to the main effect of interventions (<0.001 [0.146]), and within-between interaction effect of group and time (<0.001 [0.515]). After using Kahoot and AR, the total mean self-efficacy score was significantly higher in the intervention group than in the control group (<0.001 [0.662]). The total median motivation score was significantly higher for the Kahoot and the AR groups compared with the traditional lecture (<0.001 [0.558]). Conclusion: Kahoot games and AR significantly increased nurse students' knowledge, motivation, and self-efficacy compared with traditional MV learning classes.

However, very little has been focused on student learning through game making, especially in science. Moreover, none of the studies on learning through making games has presented an account of how students engage in the process of game design in real time. The present study seeks to address that gap. We report an exploratory embedded case study in which three groups of students in one classroom created a computer game designed to teach peers about climate science, while drawing on scientific knowledge, principles of game design, and computational thinking practices. Data sources were student design sheets, computer video, and audio screen capture while students created their game, and interviews after completing the curriculum unit. A theme-driven framework was used to code the data. A curricular emphasis on systems across climate systems, game design, and computational thinking practices provided a context designed to synergistically supported student learning. This embedded case study provides a rich example of what a collaborative game design task in a constructionist context looks like in a middle school science classroom, and how it supports student learning. Game design in a constructionist learning environment that emphasized learning through building a game allowed students to choose their pathways through the learning experience and resulted in learning for all despite various levels of programming experience. Our findings suggest that game design may be a promising context for supporting student learning in STEM disciplines. © 2023 The Authors.

In this study, we present an enhanced approach for churn forecasting by integrating sentiment analysis of Steam reviews into the churn forecasting model, leveraging the vast Steam database. Steam, a prominent digital distribution platform for video games, boasts a large user dataset. Our dataset comprises 12,000 user reviews across four game types. Our approach involves extracting sentiment polarity to generate a sentiment score, which is then embedded in the time series data used for churn modelling. We developed a churn forecasting (CF) model using Vector Autoregression, incorporating the sentiment analysis (SA) predictive model with a Support Vector Machine using grid search and hyperopt, achieving an accuracy of 89%, precision of 84%, recall of 85%, and an F1 score of 84%. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional churn prediction models, significantly enhancing churn forecasting accuracy. The CF model with SA yielded the lowest Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 10.37% among the four models developed for each game type, indicating its efficacy. These findings underscore the value of integrating sentiment analysis of user reviews to gain valuable insights for businesses aiming to reduce churn and enhance customer satisfaction. In information systems, this study emphasizes understanding game industry stakeholders’ demands, including shareholders and customers through machine learning development research. The game industry reacts proactively to stakeholder complaints by creating an inclusive and responsive organizational culture using sentiment analysis.

However, since we do not know the specific elements responsible for attitude change, the potential of video games to achieve desired educational or behavioural outcomes often remains unfulfilled. Objectives: To fill the research gap, our study examined whether the perspective-taking game mechanic in the serious game Czechoslovakia 38–89: Borderlands, which had previously been shown to affect attitudes, would have the same effect on another sample of players with different characteristics. Methods: We have assessed the effect of a historical video game using a perspective-taking mechanic on players' explicit and implicit attitudes. Explicit attitude changes were measured at a general level, meaning a broad evaluation of a depicted historical event, and at a specific level, meaning a more detailed evaluation of specific aspects of the event. Simultaneously, we measured the effect of players' perceived attitude importance on attitude change. The study used a sample of 137 young adults. Results and Conclusions: This study's results indicate a significant pretest-posttest explicit attitude change on the general level and on a specific level in comparison to the control group. Perspective-taking game mechanics is particularly important for explicit attitude change. No change was found in implicit attitudes. The effect of the perceived attitude importance on attitude change was not confirmed. Takeaways: As one of the first to focus on the effects of specific game mechanics on attitudes, this study confirmed that perspective-taking has stable, short-term effects on attitude change even across different research samples. © 2023 The Authors.

To better strengthen undergraduate students’ mastery of electron configurations of atoms and ions, we designed a novel, interactive chemistry game called ChemisTree that uses active-learning techniques (e.g., physically building electron configurations onto a game board, small group work, and whole class discussion) and incorporates the three rules for electrons filling orbitals (Aufbau principle, Pauli exclusion principle, and Hund’s rule), using LEGO tiles and plates to represent electrons and orbitals. Students watch an introductory video explaining the rules and components of the game prior to applying their knowledge of electron configuration by working in small groups to build the orbital diagrams of atoms and ions using the materials provided in their ChemisTree game kits. Student understanding is assessed using multiple-choice pre/post-test questions, scoring sheets with peer discussion, and self-reported postactivity evaluations. Students who played the game scored significantly higher in the post-test (62.7%) compared to the pre-test (51.2%), representing an 11.5% increase in average score.

Methods: An engaging educational program named Essential Skills and Knowledge in Learning Laser (ESKILLD) was developed to teach laser applications in dentistry. The program comprises two primary components: a “Tutorial and Quiz” section and a “Games” section. Final-year dental students were tasked with installing and using this application. A 29-item validated questionnaire (Cronbach's alpha = 0.97, ICC = 0.94) was used to evaluate students' perceptions of the applications' design and functionality. The influence of participants' gender and Grade Point Average (GPA) on their satisfaction levels was examined via the student t-test and Pearson's correlation, with a significance level of 0.05. Results: The study had 56 participants, of which 37 were female (66.07%), and 19 were male (33.92%). The students' average GPA was 15.16 out of 20. The mean rating for ESKILLD's design and functionality was 1.39 ± 0.47 and 1.37 ± 0.46, respectively, signifying a high satisfaction level. Female students rated the application's coherence and learning perception significantly higher than their male counterparts (p < 0.05). However, gender did not significantly influence scores on other perception aspects or overall scores. Students' GPAs and their perception scores did not have a significant correlation. Conclusions: The results indicate that the participants were generally satisfied with the game's features and attitudes towards it, which underscores the potential effectiveness of gamification in dental courses focused on laser applications. © The Author(s) 2024.","Dental education; e-learning; Educational technology; Gamification; Laser","Education, Dental; Educational Measurement; Female; Humans; Lasers; Male; Personal Satisfaction; Students, Dental; Surveys and Questionnaires; Video Games; Young Adult; dental education; dental student; education; female; human; laser; male; procedures; psychology; questionnaire; satisfaction; video game; young adult","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85194877834"

However, their use in schools remains minimal despite their many educational and pedagogical benefits. This lack of interest is partly due to educational SGs’ visibility problem. Indeed, they are mainly indexed in catalogues containing all types of SGs (not necessarily educational). Also, the existing catalogues, often designed by video game editors, do not offer relevant and practical filters to help teachers find SGs suited to their specific needs. This article proposes JEN-Planet, a catalogue designed from several research contributions to help teachers find existing educational SGs. A comparative study is carried out on its usability, relevance, and utility against those of two other major catalogues. 50 teachers explored the different catalogues and evaluated them through questionnaires.

At the same time, adopting new pedagogical approaches often contests teachers’ professional identities and confidence. In this paper, we examine a graduate course on game-based learning, designed for professionals such as teachers and practitioners. While video games and game-based learning have gained attention from researchers and practitioners, they may pose challenges for many teachers. We observed that this course could provide opportunities for participants to construct their narratives in relation to gaming and learning over time. They may also reinterpret and extend their cultural worlds as part of their teacher identity. We conclude that enabling teachers to confront tensions and risks of adopting unfamiliar practices could help them transform their self-narratives. This study could inform design considerations to support teachers’ adopting innovative pedagogies in future research and practices on professional learning. It is also important to acknowledge that the study had limited participant diversity and representativeness. There is the need for further exploration of teachers with different backgrounds and experiences in order to better understand the challenges and opportunities of adopting innovative pedagogies. © Association for Educational Communications and Technology 2023.","Game-based learning; New pedagogical approaches; Self-narratives; Teacher identity","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85176356857"

We aimed to develop an online 3D AR of human urinary system (HUS) as a supplementary tool to aid in the teaching and learning process whether via online or traditional teaching methods, particularly for undergraduate medical students. Augmented reality human urinary system (ARenal) is an Android application that implements AR for better comprehension of the HUS. It is an original work of 3D models, diagrams, pictures, notes, self-recording videos, quizzes and a manual. The AR elements will improve learning effectiveness and attention span, enabling students to comprehend anatomical principles, basic physiology, and common disorders of HUS. Instead of 3D on paper, students can access educational resources and AR tools via a detailed 3D kidney model on Android devices. The user acceptability testing (UAT) (n = 10) revealed that 60% of participants indicated it was their first experience with AR, and 60% strongly agreed that ARenal was operating well. They also strongly agreed that it is user-friendly (50%). Most participants expressed a higher level of acceptability for ARenal and recommended adding more activities, games, quizzes, and other features to the 3D model for better interaction. In conclusion, ARenal has the potential to be employed as an additional aid for learning the HUS. © Malaysian Association of Education in Medicine and Health Sciences and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia. 2024.","Android application; ARenal; Augmented reality; Human urinary system; Supplemental tool","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85201233520"

Our review identifies and critically analyses studies of interventions designed to provide procedural training via these media and to test learning outcomes associated with these interventions. Methods: We undertook a systematic search of the literature published between January 2013 and March 2023 related to immersive procedural training interventions using HMDs. Our search methods and protocol were guided by the PRISMA framework. Results: Thirty-three studies fulfilled the broader inclusion criteria, while 23 fit the stricter criteria of measuring a procedural learning outcome. Studies were categorized into three broad types: design or usability studies, media comparisons, and value-added research. Learning environments were divided into 360° video representations, serious games, and simulations. Learning outcomes included knowledge gain, retention, and transfer. A subset of 16 study results that fit the criteria to be included in the meta-analysis show a significant positive medium effect size overall of immersive procedural training on learning outcomes as compared to less immersive environments. Knowledge transfer outcomes show the largest effect sizes. Conclusions: Our systematic review of the literature highlights the richness and diversity of existing studies. We find strong support for immersive procedural training and suggest an important role for embodied cognition in maximizing learning outcomes. However, we also find a lack of consistency in intervention design, measured outcomes, and terminology among studies. In the future, more studies using experimental research designs on similar types of applications and outcome measures are needed to rigorously test these trends. © 2024 The Authors","Augmented and virtual reality; Evaluation methodologies; Pedagogical issues; Simulations","Computer aided instruction; E-learning; Helmet mounted displays; Knowledge management; Virtual reality; Augmented and virtual realities; Effect size; Evaluation methodologies; Head-mounted-displays; Immersive; Immersive learning; Learning outcome; Pedagogical issues; Simulation; Systematic literature review; Serious games","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85199956187"

This is especially important because there is usually limited time and exposure to authentic input in class. Contexts in which English is regarded as a foreign language warrant scrutiny since English is now highly accessible to learners at virtually all ages, worldwide, at no/low cost, thanks mostly to technology. The present longitudinal study set out to examine 350 Hong Kong junior-secondary-school learners’ informal engagements with extramural English activities (e.g. watching videos; playing computer games). The relationship between their engagements and language proficiency was also investigated. The findings revealed that as many as 90% of the participants had informal extramural exposure to English. This exposure was classified into seven categories. Overall, the three most popular types of engagement were videos/movies, songs, and communication (e.g. face-to-face chats; text messages). Intriguingly, the overall levels of engagements were correlated significantly and positively with proficiency scores for the average- and high-proficiency groups, but no such relationship was found for the low-proficiency students.

In real-life, complex, human-centric tasks, such as education and healthcare, data can be noisy and limited. Batch RL is designed for handling such situations where data is limited yet noisy, and where building simulations is challenging. In two consecutive empirical studies, we investigated Batch DRL for pedagogical policy induction, to choose student learning activities in an Intelligent Tutoring System. In Fall 2018 (F18), we compared the Batch DRL policy to an Expert policy, but found no significant difference between the DRL and Expert policies. In Spring 2019 (S19), we augmented the Batch DRL-induced policy with a simple act of explanation by showing a message such as “The AI agent thinks you should view this problem as a Worked Example to learn how some new rules work.”. We compared this policy against two conditions, the Expert policy, and a student decision making policy. Our results show that 1) the Batch DRL policy with explanations significantly improved student learning performance more than the Expert policy; and 2) no significant differences were found between the Expert policy and student decision making. Overall, our results suggest that pairing simple explanations with the Batch DRL policy can be an important and effective technique for applying RL to real-life, human-centric tasks. © 2022, International Artificial Intelligence in Education Society.","Deep reinforcement learning; Explanation; Pedagogical policy","Computer aided instruction; Decision making; Deep learning; Education computing; Learning systems; Students; Decisions makings; Deep reinforcement learning; Explanation; Human-centric; Pedagogical policy; Performance; Reinforcement learnings; Simple++; Student learning; Student performance; Reinforcement learning","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142853122"

However, there are important barriers in learning POCUS, including lack of practice time and lack of experts for supervision. Alternative learning tools may assist in overcoming these barriers. A serious game is being developed specifically for teaching ultrasound. In this study, we assessed the use of a serious game in learning POCUS. Methods: Ultrasound-native medical students were randomly assigned to the intervention group (N = 27) or the control group (N = 26). Both groups performed a real ultrasound on a volunteer after a brief introduction, but the intervention group played a serious game in advance. The endpoints were the assessments of the videos by experts (scoring quality of the probe movements) and the research team (counting probe movements), and probe movements measured with an accelerometer. Results: The intervention group completed the exam faster (247 s vs. 347 s, p = 0.006 (95% CI: [30.20;168.80]) and lifted the probe less frequently from the model (0.54 vs. 3.79, p = 0.001 (95% CI: [1.39;5.11]). Also, we found an in-game learning effect between levels, showing a 48% decrease in total playing time (p < 0.001), 36% reduction in attempts per coin (p = 0.007), a 33% reduction in total probe distance (p = 0.002), and a 61% decrease in contact moments (p < 0.001). However, there was no significant difference in expert score between the two groups. Conclusion: The serious game ‘Underwater’ is a fun and useful addition to traditional bedside ultrasound learning, which also may overcome one of the most important barriers in learning ultrasound: lack of supervised practice time. We show that the game improves real-practice probe handling with faster and more goal-oriented probe movements. © 2023, The Author(s).","Internal medicine; POCUS; Serious game; Ultrasound education","Humans; Learning; Motivation; Point-of-Care Systems; Point-of-Care Testing; Ultrasonography; controlled study; echography; human; learning; motivation; point of care testing; randomized controlled trial","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85180254353"

In view of gender equality, the study examined the experiences of two Science teachers in implementing a gender-responsive approach to instruction and its impact on students' learning in secondary Science classrooms. Data were gathered through purposive sampling and descriptive phenomenology, supplemented by follow-up interviews, and then analyzed using Colaizzi's phenomenological approach. The interviews were conducted through online video calls with a semi-structured questionnaire. With thorough analysis, five major themes emerged from the teachers' shared experiences. These themes pertain to the students' genders and performances, gender-responsive approaches and methodologies, and the effects and challenges of implementing a gender-responsive approach in Science education. Furthermore, the teachers' gender responsiveness was reflected in preparing lessons, instructional materials, gender-fair language, extracurricular activities, a profiling system, sharing, group work and projects, reporting and presentation, problem-solving and laboratory activities, games, and assessments. Consequently, the teachers affirmed that gender equality among Science classroom students was achieved. With the surge of concerns surrounding students' gender, a gender-responsive approach must be upheld. Though the study's results directly relate to Science education, it is hoped that it will contribute to the pedagogical knowledge of teachers in other disciplines in integrating gender and addressing gender issues in the classroom. ©Authors.","gender equality; gender responsiveness; gender-responsive approach; Science classrooms; students’ gender issues","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85166555571"

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it was necessary to switch from colocated physical intergenerational play to online experiences. This type of experience, in which grandparents connect from their own houses to participate, represents a challenge in terms of recruiting participants and carrying out the online sessions, due to grandparents' technological insecurities and their reluctance to play videogames. Besides, intergenerational games have to be carefully designed to promote symmetrical interactions, fun, and engagement on the part of both age groups as well as to develop easy to use interfaces. In this work, we present an online storytelling game designed to be played by family teams formed by grandparents and their grandchildren. The guidelines followed, the assessment tools designed to evaluate the intergenerational dynamics and the emotions that arise during the experience are also presented. Results of the three online sessions carried out are presented and discussed. © 2008-2011 IEEE.","Intergenerational dynamics; online games; storytelling; technological acceptance","Human computer interaction; Age groups; Game; Intergenerational dynamic; Intergenerational interactions; Interview; Older adults; On-line games; Storytelling; Technological acceptance; Video-games; Leisure","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85151569318"

Geome presents environmental issues, prompting students and asking them to discern and dismiss misinformation and rumors. The study aims to analyze the students' playful learning experience and their perspective on the game. It focuses on the students' critical thinking, interactions and beliefs about knowledge and knowing, referred to as personal epistemology. Adopting a qualitative approach, the research was conducted across three classes in a museum. A combination of audio, video, and in-game interactions was collected from specific moments during gameplay and analyzed according to epistemological dimensions (Certainty, Simplicity, Source, Justification). Video analysis suggests that when faced with ill-structured problems within a playful scenario, some students are spurred to actively process information and develop critical thinking skills. Meanwhile others remain entrenched in their initial conceptions about the nature of knowledge and the act of knowing. The study discusses how the game's characteristics shape students' personal epistemology. Overall, this research demonstrates that games in museum contexts have the potential to promote active learning and critical thinking in some students, when confronted with complex or ill-structured problems. © 2023, Serious Games Society.

Recent research using immersive video-based training has shown promise, in terms of improving young children's situation awareness and looking behaviour when cycling, although such evidence is sparse. We designed and delivered a brief gamified immersive intervention to address this. Forty-four schoolchildren took part in a 10-minute intervention comprising 360-degree real-world point-of-view footage of a cycle journey through a busy urban environment, experienced via a head-mounted display (HMD) with built-in eye tracking. The participants were split into two groups: an explicit learning group who received instructions regarding adaptive looking behaviour, and an implicit learning group who received no instructions. In a gamified protocol, participants scored points for fixating on target areas that represented adaptive looking behaviour; reward sounds notified them when they were successful. The explicit learning group accrued points more rapidly in the early stages of the intervention, but the implicit learning group matched the explicit group's performance level by the end of the brief intervention. All participants’ cycling confidence increased after the brief intervention, and these increases were correlated with their performance in the game, but participants’ performance on video-based situation awareness tests did not improve. Brief gamified immersive interventions could be used to develop young cyclists’ competence, and therefore confidence, regarding cycling on roads, which could, in turn, encourage them to cycle short journeys. © 2023 The Author(s)","Cycle training; Hazard perception; Road safety; Situation awareness; Virtual reality","E-learning; Helmet mounted displays; Motor transportation; Virtual reality; Cycle training; Explicit learning; Hazard perceptions; Immersive; Implicit learning; Learning groups; Performance; Pilot studies; Road safety; Situation awareness; Eye tracking","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85164259694"

This work presents comparative data and findings obtained from 217 students who played the game in a face-to-face format (control group) and 104 students who played the game in an online format (experimental group). Background: Serious video games have been proven effective at computer science education, however, it is still unknown whether the effectiveness of these games is the same regardless of their format, face-to-face or online. Moreover, the usage of games created through authoring tools has barely been explored. Research Questions: Are teacher-authored educational video games effective in terms of learning and motivation for computer science students? Does the effectiveness of teacher-authored educational video games depend on whether they are used in a face-to-face or online format? Methodology: A quasi-experiment has been conducted by using three instruments (pre-test, post-test, and questionnaire) with the purpose of comparing the effectiveness of game-based learning in face-to-face and online formats. A total of 321 computer science students played a teacher-authored educational video game aimed to learn about software design. Findings: The results reveal that teacher-authored educational video games are highly effective in terms of knowledge acquisition and motivation both in face-to-face and online formats.

The lack of equal education and the level of access to education are two main reasons. In remote areas of Indonesia there are still very few educational facilities, either in the form of infrastructure or other facilities, one of which is learning resources. Today's learning resources can only be used in well-developed, easy-to-reach cities. They can't be used in less developed or remote areas. Reports and results of observations from some remote areas state that almost all children have used an Android but not to play games as it was meant to be used. This opens up opportunities, especially for making learning tools that can be used anywhere and anytime without a stable internet connection. This means that children can use them whenever and wherever they want. Therefore, the Exophysics book was designed with this in mind. This study aimed to develop a packaged Android application learning resource using design thinking and scientific literacy approaches. The design thinking phase comprised: (1) empathising, (2) defining, (3) ideation, (4) prototyping, and (5) testing. Five schools in remote parts of Southeast Sulawesi were selected. According to the Ministry of Education, Indonesia, the sample selection was randomly based on the relationships of several teachers, whose areas were included in the underdeveloped region category. To test products with students and teachers as respondents, the teacher sample selection was randomly conducted, involving five teachers, as the first stage of product testing. Learning media development resulted from the Exophysics book, with learning videos and game features, content, and questions. The study of how teachers and students felt about the Exophysics book strongly supports point 4 above: that it should be used as a learning resource. Therefore, exophysics books can be used as learning resources because the design development pays attention to network access needs so that students can use them anywhere and anytime. © 2023, Commonwealth of Learning.

Nevertheless, more work is needed to understand how this digital tool can be effectively integrated into the teaching and learning process. Purpose: This study sought to further investigate the effective implementation of video tagging in games lessons with 14–15-year-old students. The central aim was to explore how a Game Sense Approach can be effectively integrated with video tagging and student-led debates. The secondary aim was to investigate the emergence of so-called ‘action rules’ (game plans) which emerge from these verbal exchanges. Participants and Setting: Game Sense pedagogy and video tagging were used as a stimulus for student-led debates during seven lessons. A pragmatic epistemological approach underpinned iterative cycles of action research using recordings from student-led debates critical collegial discussions, and teacher reflections to inform the implementation of the approach. A post-hoc thematic analysis of the PHE teachers’ reflections and content analysis of student debates were then conducted. Findings: The results of the action research process revealed that organisation and what to tag were key considerations in the successful implementation of the approach. The results from student interactions showed a high level of team-based positive action rules, with a low level of negative feedback. Conclusion: This study highlights the importance of critically considering technology integration, the content of student interactions, and their pedagogical implications. The integration of video tagging in diverse game-based situations can provide pedagogical and organisational challenges.

This study aimed to explore how highly engaged adolescent gamers integrate gaming into their lives, how they experience gaming motivation, and how they view the effects that gaming has on them. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 37 adolescent gamers who played intensively and attended high schools. The interviews were analysed with thematic analysis and two main themes were extracted from the data: The integration of games into one’s life and What drives adolescent gamers to play. Adolescent gamers were found to be active integrators of gaming into their lives, mostly managing to balance gaming with other daily activities and tasks. Although a few of them experienced problematic gaming, they managed to recover, and were generally aware of the dangers. Gaming was purposeful and useful for them, for example for socialising, competition, learning English, becoming more ‘tech-savvy’, and coping with everyday stress. However, it was important for them to engage in other purposeful activities in addition to gaming and not to use gaming as an exclusive coping tool.

This study reports on promoting STEM teacher candidates’ (TCs’) implementation of technology-enhanced DI in teacher education courses. The research questions are: (1) How do TCs develop digital video games (DVGs) to be inclusive of DI?, and (2) If, and to what extent are DVGs effective tools to implement DI in secondary science classes? The analysis of eight DVGs, developed by the TCs, shows that most TCs were able to proficiently integrate DI practices in their DVGs. Furthermore, DVGs are effective tools to differentiate instruction by facilitating pacing variation for different students, differentiating difficulty levels, scaffolding, integrating multimodalities to present the content in different formats, utilizing engaging features, representing different learners of various backgrounds, promoting conceptual understanding, and enabling different assessment forms especially formative and diagnostic assessments. This research is significant as it highlights how digital resources such as DVGs can be used to address individual learners’ needs, interests, profiles, and academic achievement levels. Additionally, this research informs instructional designers, game developers, and curriculum specialists on ways to incorporate equity, diversity, and inclusion pedagogies such as DI in digital educational resources. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Differentiated instruction; digital video games; diversity; equity; inclusion; STEM education; teacher education; technology-enhanced teaching","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85150893125"

This pedagogical method involves the delivery of direct instruction outside of the classroom, utilising videos, quizzes and lecture slides to facilitate active learning during class time. To address the challenge of student motivation and enhance overall engagement, the incorporation of game-based learning within the flipped learning approach has emerged as a promising solution. This research aims to explore the potential of gaming in promoting active learning and fostering a deeper understanding of course material. The findings highlight the positive impact of gamification on student engagement and academic performance within an undergraduate Engineering module. Through the integration of game elements, such as Kahoot and a leader board system, students exhibited increased motivation and active participation throughout the course. The implementation of game-based strategies effectively captured students’ attention and facilitated a dynamic learning environment. The results demonstrated a positive correlation between engagement levels and academic performance, affirming the efficacy of gamification in promoting enhanced learning outcomes. Furthermore, this study highlighted the importance of recognising and celebrating student achievements through public displays of accomplishment. The public acknowledgement of high achievers not only instilled a sense of pride and motivation in these students but also inspired their peers to strive for excellence. The collective applause and recognition from the entire class served as a powerful reinforcement of the value and significance of active engagement in the module. These findings emphasise the potential of integrating flipped learning and game-based strategies as a comprehensive educational framework that caters to diverse student needs and maximises learning outcomes. Future research will focus on scaling up the study to encompass a wider range of undergraduate Engineering modules, involving a larger cohort of students from various disciplines. By expanding the investigation, a more comprehensive understanding of the effects of gamification on different student populations can be attained. Overall, this study contributes to the growing body of literature on gamification in education, underscores its potential to transform traditional instructional practices and promotes effective teaching and learning experiences. © 2024 Tempus Publications.

Twine is an open-source software that can be used to create intricate virtual patient games, including elements like non-linear free text history taking and time-related changes to the game’s narrative. We evaluated the incorporation of Twine virtual patient games into a diabetes acute care online learning package for undergraduate medical students at the University of Glassgow, Scotland. Methods: Three games were developed using Twine, Wacom Intuous Pro, Autodesk SketchBook, Camtasia Studio, and simulated patients. Online material included three VP games, eight microlectures, and a single best answer multiple choice question quiz. The games were evaluated at Kirkpatrick Level 1 with an acceptability and usability questionnaire. The entire online package was evaluated at Kirkpatrick Level 2 with pre- and post-course multiple choice and confidence questions, with statistical analysis performed using paired t-tests. Results: 122 of approximately 270 eligible students provided information on resource utilisation, with 96% of these students using at least one online resource. 68% of students who returned surveys used at least one VP game. 73 students provided feedback on the VP games they had played, with the majority of median responses being “agree” on positive usability and acceptability statements. The online resources were associated with a mean multiple choice score increase from 4.37 out of 10 to 7.96 out of 10 (p < 0.0001, 95% CI + 2.99 to + 4.20, n = 52) and a mean total confidence score increase from 4.86 out of 10 to 6.70 out of 10 (p < 0.0001, 95% CI + 1.37 to + 2.30, n = 48). Conclusions: Our VP games were well-received by students and promoted engagement with online material. The package of online material led to statistically significant increases in confidence and knowledge in diabetes acute care outcomes.

In light of this need, many scholars have looked towards museums, arguing that as trusted institutions of informal learning, museums are uniquely positioned to support public engagement with contentious, impactful issues like climate change. However, while several museum exhibits have emerged over recent years, empirical research on museum-based learning experiences remains quite limited. We take a step towards advancing understanding of museum-based climate change learning through an empirical investigation at a natural history museum in the US. This study examines learners’ collaborative discourse within one exhibit about climate change, a multiplayer video game called Utah Climate Challenge (UCC). Investigating moments of failure and struggle, we analyze learners’ forms of collaboration through moment-to-moment discourse analysis. Findings demonstrate the importance of scaffolding multiple types of collaboration, as well as the potential for a collaborative, museum-based videogame to support learning of important science concepts relevant to climate change. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.","Climate change; Collaboration; Informal science education; Intergenerational discourse; Museums; Videogame","","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85196105187"

However, little is known about the type of games selected by English teachers, reasons for doing so, or how games are actually used in teaching. This is particularly relevant in gendered vocational classes, with mainly girls or boys respectively in different programmes, as national surveys show that while most teenage boys play digital games, comparatively few girls do. Objectives: The primary aim was to investigate how the digital commercial game Adventures with Anxiety was used during naturally occurring English teaching in four gendered vocational classes: one Technological and Industrial Production class (boys only) and three Healthcare, Childhood and Youth development classes (girls mainly). Methods: Participants involved 36 students (aged 16–17) and two English teachers. Using a mixed methods design (Brevik, 2022), we combined quantitative and qualitative analyses of classroom video recordings (5.5 h), student screen recordings during gameplay (8 h) and retrospective teacher interviews (1.5 h). Analyses relied on the validated PLATO observation protocol (Grossman, 2015) and reflexive thematic analysis (Braun & Clarke, 2022). Results and Conclusions: English teachers expressed a dual aim in using the game for teaching English; to improve students' language skills and provide experiences of how to live with anxiety. Although the game offered relevant vocabulary and virtual experiences with anxiety; anxiety emerged as a professional component of caring professions in the girls-mainly classes, while being used to help boys acknowledge anxiety in their own lives. © 2024 The Authors.

Game-based environments for learning offer a glass box approach that can explain how and why these technologies can be suitable for teaching complex competencies like systems thinking skills in a variety of academic contexts. The glass box instructional approach can provide researchers with student data that can be used during gameplay to help students develop competencies and adapt instructional strategies that can tailor the game environment to improve student performance.

We developed several educational modules for high school students that provided them with an opportunity to learn and explore the foundations of physiological systems, nutrient needs to maintain health, and the impact that environmental factors can have on them. The modules included videos, discussion boards, games, readings, and labs. These modules were integrated into the first session: Your Body and Health. On day 1, the first module explored the basic physiology and anatomy of the body with respect to the organization of cells into organ systems. Additionally, the educational content included information on macro- and micronutrients and their impact on body development, nutrition, and metabolism. The nutrition module explored nutrition concepts and various factors that can impact healthy eating patterns, such as food insecurity issues and the consumption of ultraprocessed foods. A lab activity on label reading was included to help empower students to make healthy choices. A total of 43 high school students participated in the program. Overall, the quality of the educational content in the modules was rated highly by the students, and they indicated that the educational experience inspired them to learn more about the physiology and nutrition concepts associated with human metabolism, and the importance of healthy food choices to maintain health.

In the field of tobacco prevention, the deployment of playful activities for the development of life skills has received little attention. This review describes the methods and results of tobacco prevention interventions using playful activities to develop life skills in children and preteens. A literature search was conducted in the PubMed, Web of Science and PsycInfo databases. Articles were included in the review based on the following five criteria: (1) the article totally or partially concerns a study of a tobacco prevention intervention; (2) the subjects were children and preteens aged between 6 and 12 years (with an average age within this age range or with an interval including all or part of this age range), from a general or specific population; (3) the intervention was a life skills development action or program; (4) playful activities were employed; (5) design, implementation, evaluation methods and/or results are available in the article. A total of 11 studies, composed of 9 interventions, were included in this systematic review. Most were carried out in school settings (n = 8/11) and involved teachers (n = 7/11). Web-based interventions (video games, mobile health games/websites and e-learning programs) were the playful activities most often used (n = 4/11). The majority of the interventions aimed to develop social skills such as the ability to resist pressure (n = 9/11). In this review, there were only four randomized controlled trial (n = 4/11). The evaluation was immediately after the RCTs. Among the measured outcome variables, knowledge (n = 8/11), attitudes (n = 5/11), intentions (n = 5/11), self-efficacy (n = 4/11) and skills (n = 3/11) were the most assessed. Only two of the studies reviewed here conducted a process evaluation (n = 2/11). This systematic review provides guidance for future youth smoking prevention interventions. Among these, a process evaluation is strongly suggested, as well as the use of appropriate variables and validated scales to assess the effectiveness of prevention programs. In addition, participatory research must allow for the design of adapted and relevant interventions, but also for the proper development of intervention research methodologies in health promotion. © 2023","Adolescents; Children; Interventions; Life skills; Playful activities; Tobacco prevention","adolescent; article; child; comparative effectiveness; e-learning; female; health promotion; human; juvenile; male; Medline; outcome assessment; outcome variable; participatory research; PsycINFO; randomized controlled trial (topic); self concept; smoking prevention; social competence; systematic review; teacher; tobacco; video game; Web of Science; web-based intervention","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85161597574"

The purpose of this research is to provide evidence for the efficacy of a model for teaching the fundamentals of the floor exercise roll through the medium of a video game in junior high school. Three subject matter experts and three media specialists evaluated the research and validated the learning model using a set of established criteria. This study is occurring within the product development phase with ten stage. A questionnaire was utilised to obtain data for determining the model's accuracy. Descriptive percentages were used to assess the data. The average model validity ratings found in this research show that the material expert validator is 83.33 percent valid and the media expert validator is 89.4 percent valid. The validity score generated by the combination of the three validators is very high quality. Consequently, it is reasonable to infer that the floor exercise roll basic technique learning model based on a game is genuine and can be applied in the context of school-based sports education. Sports educators and curriculum designers can use the favourable feedback from material and media experts to inform the design of more effective learning models for students to become proficient in floor exercises and fundamental rolling technique. © 2024 Nevzat Demirci.

However, with the growing use of, and accessibility to, online-linked devices, children are engaging more and more in screen-time linked activities and less time in non-technology play. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the influence of children’s screen-time use on their play patterns. This study aims to explore the relationship between school-age children’s screen time and their engagement and participation in play occupations. Methods: Twenty-six pairs of parents and children were recruited to complete the Children’s Play Scale (CPS), parent and child versions of the Children’s Screen Time Use Report (CSTUR), and the Children’s Perceptions of Their Play (CPTP). Data were analyzed using Spearman’s rho correlations and linear regressions with bootstrapping. Results: Two regression models found that weekday social screen time accounted for 30.7% of the total variance (p =.002) of social play while weekend educational screen time, weekday interactive screen time, and weekday passive screen time together accounted for 55.6% of the total variance (p <.001) of active play. Conclusion: The study findings provide evidence that a relationship exists between school-aged children’s screen time and play engagement and participation.

The main goals behind studying emotions in all areas other than psychology and neuroscience are to maximize beneficial emotions, reduce detrimental ones and to develop adaptive systems. The combination of this concept and recent progress in technology has spurred researchers across various fields to focus on incorporating an emotional aspect into human-computer interaction. In Serious Games context, learner-player can experience two types of emotions, the first is related to the learning elements and the second is referred to video games elements. In both learning and video games contexts, recent studies have introduced affective models to conceptualize the influence of emotions within these spheres. However, a discernible trend emerges in the realm of Serious Games research. Notably, the majority of recent studies within this domain exhibit a notable inclination towards prioritizing aspects such as personalized emotion recognition, adaptive gameplay, real-time feedback mechanisms, emotion regulation training, immersive experiences via mixed reality, longitudinal studies, and collaborative cross-disciplinary initiatives. As a result, the nuanced pursuit of affective modeling for learners-players often experiences relegation, yielding precedence to these innovative trajectories. Within this conceptual framework, this article endeavors to examine the interconnection between the emotional experiences of learner-players and the educational and interactive components inherent in serious games. © 2023, Serious Games Society.

It is an educational approach to teaching and learning that involves groups of students working together to solve a problem, complete a task, or even create a product based on a project. It places the student at the center of the teaching–learning process and stimulates their engagement to transform learning into knowledge. Proposal: The aim of the present study was to use an adapted PBL approach as a physiology teaching strategy for sophomore medical students. For this, at the end of the semester, 148 students were organized in groups and were instructed to develop projects on the topics of cardiorespiratory physiology and metabolic physiology. Evaluation was made of the development and presentation of the projects, comparing the grades with those obtained in tests taken individually by the students at the beginning of the semester. The opinions of the students about the strategy were analyzed using a questionnaire answered individually. The results showed that different strategies were developed by the students to present their projects, notably employing question and answer board games, card games, and videos simulating interviews with clinicians. The mean scores for the collaborative group activities were significantly higher than for the tests performed individually by the students. The answers given in the opinion questionnaire indicated that most of the students considered the strategy useful for their learning, since it stimulated research, study, and discussion on the topics studied. Most of the students believed that working as a group was beneficial and that the time allocated for the project development was sufficient. Conclusion: Therefore, use of the adapted project-based learning as a physiology teaching strategy was viewed positively by the students and improved their performance in learning about cardiorespiratory and metabolic physiology. © The Author(s) under exclusive licence to International Association of Medical Science Educators 2024.","Collaborative work; Education; Engagement; Integration; Learning; Physiology","","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85195270037"

In this course, which ran in Fall 2021, students were given the option to choose either a video game-based assignment sequence or a traditional reading response assignment sequence. Both assignment sequences required similar activities and output: reading primary and secondary source literature, reflecting on a question prompt, and writing an essay in response to the prompt. The primary difference was that students who opted for the video game sequence also completed a series of tasks within the video Assassin’s Creed: Odyssey. After the course, students were provided with a short quantitative and qualitative survey in which they could reflect upon their learning experience, and these results were then compared between the students who opted for the video game-based assignment sequence and the more traditional assignment sequence. Preliminary results show that students who opted for the video game assignment sequence gave, on average, higher ratings with regard to their enjoyment of the course assignments and with regard to the amount of learning they felt they achieved. This suggests that the implementation of video game-based pedagogy may be a useful strategy for history, archaeology, and classics courses in the future. Caution is urged, however, due to the small sample size, the non-random sampling strategy, and the lack of objective learning outcome measurement. © 2024 Ubiquity Press.

Historically, genre labels have been used to quickly classify games into (at least somewhat) nonoverlapping types of experiences. Genre labels have been successfully used in previous research to describe differences in experiences across games. However, modern video games increasingly borrow conventions from myriad genres. This increased complexity of modern games calls to question the applicability of genre labels to such research endeavors. Here we sought to determine whether it would be possible to create a valid continuous description of video games instead.We crowdsourced recognizable lists of 100 comparative retro (1985–1995) and 100 modern (2013–2020) video games. Fifty thousand human triplet comparison decisions regarding those games were then used to seed a machine learning algorithm to establish a continuous two-dimensional space in which individual video games could be situated. These two game spaces (modern/retro) were found to have reasonable validity and could be used to visualize and support beliefs about the game space, and how it has changed over the past 30 years. © 2024 American Psychological Association","game classifications; machine learning; media genres; retro video games; video game genres","","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85189138751"

The data was collected from respondents residing in India and elements of gamification (achievement, immersion and social) and personal characteristics of learners (self-efficacy, computer anxiety and enjoyment) and their impact on perceived ease of use (PEOU) and perceived usefulness (PU) were tested. Design/methodology/approach: The data were collected from students and professionals who have ever played games during learning while using an e-learning module. Structural equation modeling using smart partial least square was used to create a model. Findings: The findings showed that enjoyment affected both PEOU and PU and attitude toward e-learning. Achievement and social elements impacted attitude and the immersion element moderated the relation between enjoyment and PEOU and PU. These finally impact attitude and satisfaction, leading to higher intention to use e-learning platforms. Research limitations/implications: Because this study is very specific to the Indian context, a broad generalization requires further exploration in other cultural contexts. The absence of this exploration is one of the limitations of this study. Originality/value: This study tested the GAMEFULQUEST suggested by Högberg et al.

It can help students share representations amongst themselves and work together on a shared virtual activity space. In research on the role of shared screens or shared virtual workspace in learning settings, there has been less attention paid to contexts where learners are co-located. This paper looks at the impact of the shared screen in a computational game environment on mathematics learning and practices and the construction of learners' emotions and social status in classroom interactions. We designed two versions of a simple arithmetic game: a solo version in which the student played the game alone and a multi-player version in which the screen was shared, and the players could see the arithmetic moves of the other players. We implemented these two versions of the game in a 4th-grade classroom in a suburban school in a large metropolis in India. Classroom sessions were video recorded, computer logs were collected, and field notes were taken. Focus group sessions were held with the students. We coded a portion of the data to get at patterns of classroom interactions. Then we drew on qualitative video analysis tools to analyze specific episodes to understand the fine timescale dynamics of dominant interaction patterns in each setting. Our analysis shows that the shared screen served as a shared memory device, keeping a record of all the students' posts, and was entangled in the moment-to-moment dynamics of self- and peer- assessments of arithmetic. These findings suggest that thoughtful integration of networked digital tools in computer-supported learning environments can increase student–student interactions and support disciplinary learning. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","CSCL; Design features; Educational games; Games with share memory space","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146956955"

This questionnaire was distributed via different social networks and communication tools. The survey aimed to understand if people around the world are interested in the idea of learning ancient Greek via a video game and if so, which video gaming activities learners prefer. The goal of the survey was therefore to understand if a ludic pedagogical approach using Digital Game-Based Learning could theoretically represent an interest experience for learners or potential learners, and furthermore to investigate their feelings, prejudices, and motivations regarding the study of ancient Greek.

Guided by Complex Learning Theory (CLT), the aim of this study was to investigate the extent to which coaches in a high-performance team sport setting report employing a range of in-session core coaching practices during both on-field and off-field sessions and their perceptions of how such practices impact player learning. Twelve Gaelic football coaches took part in semi-structured interviews. A reflective thematic analysis of the data developed four themes–(1) application of questioning by the coaches, (2) difficulties and challenges experienced when using questioning, (3) using video analysis to maximise learning and (4) the coach as a facilitator of player learning. Findings showed that coaches were aware of and employing many of the core practices advocated in the sports coaching literature. Coaches employed varied questioning to give players an active role within both on-field and video review sessions to enhance their overall game understanding. However, numerous challenges expressed by coaches suggested it was not a consistent tool in their coaching practice. The coaches recognised the need to facilitate player learning by employing core practices which encourage player autonomy and prolonged dialogue, although this was mostly reported to take place in off-field activities such as video analysis and pre/post session meetings. The current study highlighted an epistemological gap with some coaches demonstrating awareness of advocated strategies but failing to support these claims with tangible examples in their practice. This investigation supports the application of CLT as a suitable theoretical framework in which to interpret the core practices coaches employ in their practice. The introduction of CLT to coaches may promote a sustained and sophisticated application of core coaching practices within the delivery of coaching sessions. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Complex learning theory; core practices; game-based approaches; pedagogy; questioning","article; awareness; conceptual framework; football; human; learning; learning theory; pedagogics; perception; semi structured interview; team sport; thematic analysis; videorecording","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85165291129"

Box 51178, Riyadh, 11543, Saudi Arabia","Reinforcement learning (RL) is revolutionizing the artificial intelligence (AI) domain and significantly aiding in building autonomous systems with a higher level comprehension of the world as we observe it. Deep learning (DL) facilitates RL to scale and resolve previously intractable problems, for instance, allowing supervision principles designed for robots to be acquired directly from visual data, developing video game proficiency from pixel-level information, etc. Recent research shows that RL algorithms help represent problems dealing with high-dimensional, unprocessed data input and can have successful applications in computer vision, pattern identification, natural language analysis, and speech parsing. This research paper focuses on training a simulation model of a car to navigate autonomously on a racetrack using RL. The study explores several fundamental algorithms in Deep RL, namely Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), Deep Q-network (DQN), and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG). The paper documents a comparative analysis of these three prominent algorithms—based on their speed, accuracy, and overall performance. After a thorough evaluation, the research indicates that the DQN surpassed the other existing algorithms. This study further examined the performance of the DQN with and without ε-decay and observed that the DQN with ε-decay is better suited for our objective and is significantly more stable than its non ε-decay counterpart. The findings from this research could assist in improving the performance and stability of autonomous vehicles using the DQN with ε -decay. It concludes by discussing the fine-tuning of the model for future real-world applications and the potential research areas within the field of autonomous driving. © 2023 by the authors.","autonomous driving vehicles; DDPG; DQN; PPO; reinforcement learning","algorithm; automobile; computer vision; language; machine learning; pattern recognition; training","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85172906693"

However, the development process does not take into account accessibility, universal design and inclusion, especially for the deaf student community. An extended reality model is proposed for the creation of this type of software as a tool to support access to knowledge, based on information gathering, requirements analysis, user-centred design and video game programming, including the ludic and didactic. The aim is to minimise the barriers that limit the learning of programming logic by students with hearing disabilities through the use of new technologies, creating spaces in virtual worlds that are understandable, usable and practical in conditions of safety, comfort and as much autonomy as possible. To validate the model, a mixed reality software prototype was designed and programmed to train students in programming logic, both deaf and hearing. User and heuristic tests were carried out, showing how immersion can improve knowledge acquisition processes and develop skills in higher education students. © 2023, Modern Education and Computer Science Press.

The aim of the present study was to compare the effects of a game application (intervention group) or paper scripts (control group) on knowledge acquisition and to evaluate the acceptance of the new application among dental students. Methods: The 4th semester students of the second preclinical prosthodontics course were randomly assigned to one of the two groups (n = 58/51) for two consecutive years. The study was conducted in two phases: First, all participants took a pretest, with the intervention group using the game application and the control group receiving the same set of questions in a paper script. In the second phase, all participants took a post-test. After the post-test, both groups had access to the application for another three weeks. After that, all participants completed standardized questionnaires and a scale to evaluate the usability of the system. Usage statistics were also tracked. Differences between groups were evaluated together and for both years separately in terms of pretest and posttest scores and learning success. Results: There was no significant difference between the groups with regard to the posttest and learning success. A significant improvement in knowledge between pretest and posttest (p < 0.05) was demonstrated in both groups. Each student played approximately 350 questions. Participants rated the application with the German school grade ""good"". Participants appreciated the application and rated it positively. They stated that the game motivated them to learn and that they spent more time with the learning content. Conclusion: Due to the positive perception achieved through the game, this application is able to motivate students to learn. The learning effect achieved is similar to learning on paper. © 2023, The Author(s).","Dental education; Factual knowledge training; Quiz; Serious game","Education, Dental; Education, Medical, Undergraduate; Humans; Learning; Students, Medical; Teaching; Video Games; adult; article; controlled study; dental education; dental student; female; human; human experiment; learning; major clinical study; male; perception; preclinical study; pretest posttest design; prosthodontics; questionnaire; randomized controlled trial; teaching; usability; dental education; medical education; medical student; teaching; video game","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85165370820"

For instance, those pupils who enjoyed the intervention more, played fewer video games afterwards. Also, the effect on knowledge acquisition was stronger for pupils with higher educational achievement. Gender had limited effect.

However, empirical evidence of their effectiveness is sparse. This scoping review follows PRISMA-ScR guidelines to summarize literature on serious video games for agricultural learning, highlighting research trends and identifying gaps. We systematically searched nine prominent research databases for papers on serious video games for agriculture learning published between January 2000 and July 2022. Two independent reviewers conducted screening, data extraction, and synthesized the collected data using a narrative approach. The initial search identified 3,297 articles, of which 0.58% (n = 19) were included in the review. Most reviewed games were released in the last five years, with a predominant presence in the mobile platform. They commonly employed a simulation-based approach, featuring 2-D graphics and designed for single-player experiences. These games mainly target students, focusing on crop production and sustainable agriculture. Educational theories were often unspecified in the studies. Evaluation protocols primarily consisted of pilot studies, emphasizing user experience and knowledge enhancement. Positive outcomes, such as improved user experiences, knowledge, and attitude and behavior changes, were commonly observed in these studies. This study highlights advancements in using serious video games for agricultural learning over 20 years. However, it stresses the need for deeper exploration of game elements' impact on user experience and effectiveness. Creating games for underrepresented players and specific agricultural challenges is essential, as is enhancing theoretical foundations and learning approaches. Rigorous research designs are vital for assessing game effectiveness across short, medium, and long terms.  © 2008-2011 IEEE.","Agriculture learning; educational video games; serious video games; simulations; teaching/learning strategies","Agricultural technology; Cultivation; Farms; Human computer interaction; Serious games; Agriculture learning; Educational video games; Farming; Game; Serious video game; Simulation; Teaching/learning strategy; Users' experiences; Video-games; Crops","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85186846318"

Optimal learning techniques, such as active learning, interleaving topics and conditions, and recall, can greatly enhance the speed and effectiveness with which students achieve this type of higher-order thinking. However, developing and implementing optimal learning techniques in the classroom can be both time-intensive and challenging for the instructor. In addition, students may be resistant or slow to accept novel learning processes. One way to potentially introduce these learning techniques in a fun and engaging way is through educational gaming, or using a game or game elements intentionally to support learning. In this article we present an easy-to-implement adaptation of the Codenames board game for the physiology classroom. The activity requires minimal preparation while addressing high-level learning outcomes. Postintervention surveys of students were collected in three different health-related academic programs, both graduate and undergraduate, at two different institutions. Results suggest that participating in the activity both actively engaged the students and pushed them toward high-level, integrative thinking regardless of class level. NEW & NOTEWORTHY An easy-to-implement word game (Codenames) was used to engage students in higher-level Bloom’s thinking about physiology. The gameplay required students to recall, apply, evaluate, and debate as they developed and guessed clues as part of the game. Students found the activity fun, engaging, and challenging. The activity is relatively easy to implement both online and in person, requiring at minimum a simple list of vocabulary terms. 1043-4046/24 Copyright © 2024 the American Physiological Society.","active learning; educational game; gamification; interleaving; metacognition","Curriculum; Educational Measurement; Humans; Problem-Based Learning; Students; Video Games; curriculum; education; human; problem based learning; procedures; student; video game","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85187777427"

In addition, games are one of the most popular activities across cultures and ages, and there is ample evidence that supports the benefits of using games for assessment. This field is commonly known as game-based assessment (GBA), which refers to the use of games to assess learners' competencies, skills, or knowledge. In this article, we analyze the current status of the GBA field by performing the first systematic literature review on empirical GBA studies. It is based on 65 research papers that used digital GBAs to determine: the context where the study has been applied, the primary purpose, the domain of the game used, game/tool availability, the size of the data sample, the computational methods and algorithms applied, the targeted stakeholders of the study, and what limitations and challenges are reported by authors. Based on the categories established and our analysis, the findings suggest that GBAs are mainly used in K-16 education and for assessment purposes, and that most GBAs focus on assessing STEM content, and cognitive and soft skills.

However, RM is tedious, leading to reduced motivation and concentration. In contrast, Educational Video Games (EVGs) are attractive and fun, which could be an alternative to RM. Although most studies have investigated EVGs’ effectiveness, empirical research in China’s classrooms is still scarce. Besides, the combination of EVGs and traditional classrooms is constrained by the school bell, English syllabus, hardware, etc. Consequently, their results cannot be directly applied to China’s environment. Therefore, our research compares the learning performance between RM and our Snake Game (SG) in pronunciation, spelling, and recognition. 30 junior high school students tried to remember 20 words through RM (the control group); after days, they managed to learn an additional 20 words presented through the SG (the experimental group). It was found that (1) the SG outperforms the RM in pronunciation; (2) the SG is as effective as the RM in recognition; and (3) although the RM is slightly better than the SG in spelling, the shortfall can be redeemed by the continued enjoyment and motivation of the SG. In summary, students are satisfied with the effectiveness and enjoyment of the SG. © 2024 The Author(s).

This study aims to characterize the exposure of Mexican young university students to internet audiovisual content and analyze their subjective experiences in consuming such content. Material and Methods. A multiple case study design was employed utilizing content analysis as analytical strategy. Data were collected through 15-item semi-structured interview, validated by experts calculating the content validity coefficient (CVC) before initiating data collection. Results. Sixteen participants were evaluated. Data analysis considered two general categories: A) Exposure to audiovisual content (types of media, initial devices used for viewing playful content, variations in consumption times, historical patterns of audiovisual content consumption); and B) Subjective experience of audiovisual content consumption (emotions associated with consumption, positive and negative perceptions). Category A yielded two main results: 1) Mobile devices facilitated access to audiovisual content, though television and video games remained the primary means of entry; and 2) participants exhibited a shift in interests towards more specialized content during their university years. Concerning category B, participants reported seeking audiovisual content to experience specific emotions such as fear and joy. Additionally, they highlighted benefits like social connection, entertainment, and learning. However, some reported negative effects, including experiencing negative emotions and a perceived lack of control over the time spent consuming audiovisual content. Conclusions. This research contributes to the understanding of audiovisual content consumption habits in young university students. It seeks to identify how the consumption of such content positively and negatively impacts their emotions, entertainment experiences, learning, and socialization processes. Furthermore, the study aims to shed light on potential risks associated with problematic usage patterns. © 2024, Romanian Academy Francisc I Rainer Institute of Anthropology.

Often, training programs use conventional methods, such as classroom or video lectures. However, with these methods, trainees are passive and can quickly lose their attention, thus making the safety training ineffective. Alternatively, a virtual reality (VR) serious game can be used as a hands-on training tool to motivate and engage trainees. Relevant situations are simulated in a virtual environment where trainees can learn safety concepts and awareness without causing real harm to themselves or others. The current study investigates person-centred variables: motivation and engagement. We measured how safety motivation and engagement changed with employees of a chemical company when playing the VR LaboSafe Game after a traditional video lecture. Results show that employees have a high autonomous motivation to follow safety training, particularly in terms of identified regulation. Playing the VR serious game significantly increased intrinsic motivation and engagement of the trainees. They believe that they are more active, can keep their attention better and enjoy the experience of relevant situations in a virtual environment. However, complicated usability and the unfamiliarity to VR can affect their autonomous motivation for safety training. Older employees (above 50) have more difficulties with using VR headsets than younger employees (under 30). Data suggest to combine conventional methods with VR as complementary tool and provide more frequent and smaller sessions, gradually introducing VR technology to beginners. © 2023","Engagement; Laboratory safety; Motivation; Safety training; Virtual reality","Accident prevention; Chemical industry; E-learning; Motivation; Personnel training; Serious games; Autonomous motivations; Classroom lecture; Conventional methods; Engagement; Laboratory safety; Motivation and engagements; Safety management systems; Safety training; Training program; Video lectures; adult; Article; data clustering; female; human; intrinsic motivation; male; program development; program evaluation; risk assessment; semi structured interview; video game; virtual learning environment; virtual reality; work engagement; Virtual reality","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85166487998"

However, the specific influence of the gamified training approach on participants at different rehabilitation stages has not been empirically studied, especially in the practical training effect caused by gamified interventions and the varying influence on children with different rehabilitation status. Objective: This article is thus intended to investigate the following research questions: (1) do the training performances of children at advanced rehabilitation stage differ before and after using the gamified training system? (2) Do the training performances of children at intermediate rehabilitation stage differ before and after using the gamified training system? (3) Do children enjoy the gamified training approach? Methods: For the purpose, a digital gamified auditory-verbal training system was originally developed, and a series of user experiments were organized. The training performance of 31 hearing-challenged children was assessed, and interviews with six professional therapists were conducted. Results: It can be found that generally the gamified training approach can effectively facilitate the training experience and help with the basic auditory memory and expression capabilities. Moreover, it is feasible to be applied in practical training due to the high customization of digital training contents, multimodal interactive training means, and highly enjoyable training experience. Conclusions: Regarding the specific influence, the gamified way can better improve the basic auditory-verbal performance of children at the intermediate stage since the focus is more on the ease of learning and adaption to the training system. While for children at the advanced rehabilitation stage, the precise training and professional training contents are more in demand, it is not easy to achieve quick improvements. These findings and conclusions can provide insights for further explorations and applications of the gamification approach in children’s auditory-verbal rehabilitation.

A focus of this study is to identify good teaching practice in using this tool to improve source recall as well as pupils' ability to use these sources to support evaluation. A recent blog post on Quinquennium highlighted the potential for this game to be used as a teaching tool (Hinde, 2019), while its educational potential has also been promoted by the developers releasing a Discovery Tour version as a 'game mode for educational purposes' which acts as a 'living museum' (Ubisoft, 2021). While the development of educational tools for this franchise is fairly recent, the use of video games in education is established, with games like Oregon Trail being used as early as the 1980s (Buday et al.2012, 259). Moreover, the fundamental ideas behind the use of video games, such as the player engaging in some form of virtual dialogue with the creator, is one which can be traced back to Vygotsky's ideas of learning as a socio-cultural phenomenon (1978). For example, by reacting to stimuli in the game, the player is engaging in a dialogue with the historian or game developer who created the initial stimulus, after which the game responds in turn, thereby engaging with the player's actions. Furthermore, the idea of reward or punishment for certain actions within an educational game is also drawing on behaviourist theories of education, whereby a pupil is conditioned via in-game tokens for recall of knowledge. Indeed, this is one of the ways in which game developers encourage game addiction (Vu, 2017, 1).  © The Author(s), 2024.

Yet, empirical studies that investigate the impact of IVR on science education in secondary schools are limited. This article reports a pilot study that has two objectives: First, to investigate whether learning science with IVR leads to more positive learning outcomes than that with a traditional video-viewing activity; and second, to investigate whether corrective feedback produces more positive learning outcomes than explanatory feedback in IVR-mediated contexts. A randomized, controlled pilot trial was designed during a school year at a secondary school in western China. Forty-seven participatory students were randomly assigned to a control group (learning with instructional videos, n = 17), an intervention group 1 (learning with IVR with corrective feedback, n = 15), and an intervention group 2 (learning with IVR with explanatory feedback, n = 15). We evaluated an array of student learning-related outcomes, including extraneous and germane cognitive loads, intrinsic learning motivation, academic self-efficacy, learner satisfaction, and academic achievement. The results revealed a significant difference in intrinsic learning motivation, academic self-efficacy, learner satisfaction, and academic achievement, but an insignificant difference in extraneous and germane cognitive loads when students learned with video and IVR. In terms of the type of feedback provided in IVR-mediated environments, students who were prompted with corrective feedback and explanatory feedback showed little difference in their learning outcomes.

We found a sequence of trigger, reflection, and transformation constituting perspective-challenging experiences, matching Mezirow's model of transformative learning. Most of these were game-related or 'endo-game', suggesting that medium self-reflection could be an overlooked part of everyday game reflection and appreciation. Reflections were accompanied by a wide range of emotions, including frequent epistemic emotions, and emotions could change drastically even during short gameplay experiences.

This research seeks to offer insight for game producers and educational institutions to investigate the effectiveness of these motivators for increasing player motivations and thus improving the quality of learning. Sentiment analysis and LDA topic modeling were used to analyze reviews of five selected video games on the Steam platform. The 6 C’s Learning Motivation Model guided text mining to analyze the motivational factors used in the games and how they contribute to user learning. The effectiveness of these motivational factors was discussed in conjunction with categorized text mining. Results show that the major motivation factors of educational games are ‘construction meaning’, ‘challenge’, and ‘control’ in the 6 C’s learning motivation model. Among them, users focus on whether the game’s content meets their interests and the construction of the educational meaning of the game. The advantage of control, a high degree of motivational factor in video games, may turn out to be a factor that leads to user churning when the game is not interesting or attractive enough. Previous educational game research seldom involved a large sample size for generalizable findings. In addition, this research extends the application of the 6 C’s learning motivation model to the digital educational gaming arena, providing a novel player-centric perspective. Based on the results, we provide recommendations and design considerations for educational game developers to enhance players’ experience and motivations. © The Author(s) 2024.","6 C’s learning motivation model; Educational video games; Game-based education; LDA topic modeling; Learning motivation; Sentiment analysis; Text mining","","Article","Article in press","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85192392195"

Thanks to its interdisciplinary nature which is mainly rooted in the close relation between human–computer interaction, user experience design and the learning sciences, LXD is a field that demands frameworks to design and develop products that can grow into services, to create interactive learning environments able to provide improvement-driven analytics and to guarantee a significant and satisfactory experience, designed to achieve learning outcomes. Innovative Village serious video game (IVVG) is a service-oriented product within an entrepreneurship and innovation system of platforms developed as an abilities-focused learning environment, and that builds a case study for LXD. This research aims to contribute to the consolidation of the emergent field of Learning Experience Design by providing a case around the Entrepreneurship and Innovation area from EAFIT University in Medellin, a learning system that comprises several service-oriented products; by being one of the products that constitute this system, and as a serious video game, Innovative Village has proven to be a key player in facilitating the learning outcomes and the knowledge integration that stem from the learning environment of the Interactive Design program, where the students’ learning experiences take place. First, related theoretical concepts and historical data will be analyzed to provide background information, then the case study will be addressed focusing on the materials, methods, and results. The study shows that the video game encourages collaborative behavior between players, as perceived by a significant proportion of participants. The research establishes a link between this perception and the role of creaticides in the game. Learning Experience Design (LXD) is about creating products that link the learning process with key competences. The game “Innovative Village” exemplifies this approach and provides insights into design, use, and required competencies. It also presents a framework for designing user-centered learning experiences that incorporate assessments to enhance the learning process. This framework is applicable from the early stages and can be tested in real learning environments.

While previous research addresses this problem through aspects of policy making, design, and teachers' identity, we suggest a focus on teachers' engagement in learning during PD sessions. Engagement is critical for learning processes and outcomes and affects teachers' professional learning, and, hence, their teaching. Yet little research explores teachers' engagement during professional learning. Most researchers approach engagement from a psychological perspective, using self-report tools, usually questionnaires. To enable a more complete understanding of science teacher engagement in PD, we offer a novel multimodal contextual perspective on engagement, one that perceives engagement as embodied, situated, local, and dynamic. We present a multimodal situated analytical tool referring to the expected behavior in specific contexts, as defined by the norms of the situation and its participants. To develop the tool and apply it, we used video-recorded PD sessions of Israeli elementary and middle school science teachers, focusing our analysis on the engagement of 10 teachers over 21.5 h. We used multimodal analysis to map teachers' engagement in relation to the requested action, referring to: (1) five engagement levels determined by the expected behavior; (2) different engagement modalities—verbal, body posture and gestures, gaze, and facial expressions; and (3) engagement duration. We demonstrate the potential of this analytical framework to advance the understanding of PD interactions by comparing: (1) two teachers' engagement in the same activity; and (2) teachers' engagement in three PD activities: whole-class learning, game playing, and inquiry-into-practice. The analysis reveals differences within and between teachers, as well as between the activities, in levels of engagement and alignment between modalities. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of these findings and suggest how the tool may be applied in research. © 2022 The Authors.

This current research explores how elementary school students’ digital self-efficacy might relate to experiences in video game environments to influence perceptions of digital competence. We examine the differential impact of sex, self-efficacy, and socioeconomic status (SES) on 7–10-year-old students’ (N = 613) perceptions of video gaming and their digital skills. Analysis revealed the unexpected finding that SES was inversely related to enjoyment for gaming and digital technology, with students in the lower-SES category responding more positively compared to students in higher SES categories. As expected, boys self-reported digital skills higher than girls across all SES categories. We argue for the use of gaming pedagogies to support learning in classrooms that accounts for nuances in students’ digital self-efficacy moderated by gender and SES. © 2022 The Author(s).

Although many protocols use videogames in children with CP, few apply or examine motor learning principles. This study aims at (1) implementing therapist–user–designer collaboration in adapting a videogame to the principles of motor learning and the characteristics of users with CP, and (2) piloting the effectiveness of these adaptations by analyzing the achievement of motor learning parameters (learning rate acquisition, retention, and transfer to motor and somatosensory function). Materials and Methods: Periodical interprofessional meetings conducted to the adaptation of a videogame, requiring the control of a joystick for traveling through a maze, to motor learning principles. In a pilot validation, effects in unilateral upper limb function, gross manual dexterity, and somatosensory thresholds were assessed before and after 10-week training in 13 children with CP. Results: After 10-week training with the adapted serious game, children showed learning rates above 90% and improvement in motor learning parameters along the sessions. Manual dexterity and pronation–supination of the dominant hand improved after training. No significant effects were found on somatosensory thresholds. Conclusion: Serious games are useful as motor learning tools for improving motor function in children with PC. Cooperative work among professionals and users is advisable for designing efficient videogames according to rehabilitation best practices. ª Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.","Cerebral palsy; Motor learning; Motor rehabilitation; Serious games","Cerebral Palsy; Child; Humans; Learning; Motor Skills; Upper Extremity; Video Games; cerebral palsy; child; human; learning; motor performance; upper limb; video game","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85166550741"

The overall findings revealed children are interested in popular culture (e.g., playing Lego Jurassic World as a digital game, watching Princess Mononoke as an animation, and engaging with Drawing for Kids applications in English) and their dominant Discourses at home were gaming, narration, female role-modeling, music, and artistic experiences. Moreover, the findings showed that the role of mothers as scaffolders is essential for enhancing their children's learning at home, whether by asking questions or helping children discuss their favorite popular culture.

To acquire rhythm abilities, the synchronisation between body and rhythm patterns is fundamental. Extensive research has shown the link between the auditory-motor system and rhythm acquisition; however, other sensorimotor systems also improve rhythm skills. Rhythm acquisition can be trained using new technologies, such as video games; however, most of these use mainly auditory stimuli to improve it. Therefore, in this work, we explore tactile stimuli to improve rhythm skills using a video game and how visual elements affect rhythm perception using different stimuli. We evaluate and compare the synchronisation of 27 participants following either vibrotactile or auditory stimuli emitted through a rhythm video game in two difficulty levels and we evaluated the user experience. Consistent with the literature, our results indicate that participants synchronised slightly better using auditory than vibrotactile stimuli and players’ performance was better when they had visual guides. A fatigue effect persisted and increased over playtime in both conditions. In the current study, usability measures indicate no significant differences. These findings suggest that vibrotactile stimuli are also suitable to train rhythm skills in a video game environment and the game-elements play an important role in players' performance. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","auditory; games-based learning; Rhythm learning; sensorimotor system; vibrotactile","Human computer interaction; Interactive computer graphics; Learning systems; Auditory; Auditory stimuli; Early musics; Game-based Learning; Music education; Performance; Rhythm learning; Sensorimotor systems; Vibrotactile; Video-games; Synchronization","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85166964331"

However, scholars have pointed out that learning with game elements that may lead to poor learning outcomes. Therefore, this study proposes a self-regulated-based gamified interactive e-book (S-GIEB) to stimulate students to monitor their learning process in a flipped mathematics classroom with the expectation of improving their learning performance and affection. A total of 120 sixth grade students were divided into three groups: students who used self-regulation-based interactive e-book in a flipped mathematics classroom (S-GIEB group), students who learned with gamified interactive e-book in a flipped mathematics classroom (GIEB group), and those who learned with instructional videos in a traditional flipped classroom (TFC group). The findings revealed that incorporating self-regulated strategies in gamified interactive e-books can significantly enhance primary students' learning achievement, self-regulation abilities, learning motivation, and meta-cognition tendency. This suggests that such an approach not only fosters better academic performance but also cultivates important skills like self-regulation abilities and meta-cognition. The study underlines the potential of technology-enhanced learning tools to revolutionize traditional teaching methods, offering a blueprint for future educational innovations.

Methodology: This research implemented a survey methodology. A closed-ended questionnaire was administered to 252 L2 learners of English who studied at a state university in Northern Türkiye. In addition to the scales that measured L2 anxiety and CA, the questionnaire comprised six items related to EE activities (i.e. playing video games, watching TV, listening-related, reading-related, writing-related, and speaking-related EE). The data were analysed using Spearman’s correlation and multiple regression analyses. Findings: Significant, negative correlations were found between EE engagement and L2 anxiety at different levels, with moderate relationships between playing video games and listening anxiety; between speaking-related EE and speaking anxiety; between speaking-related EE and CA. EE engagement significantly predicted three variables in negative ways: it explained 17% of listening anxiety, 17% of speaking anxiety, and 15% of CA. While playing video games and speaking-related EE were significant predictors of listening and speaking anxiety, speaking-related EE was the only significant predictor of CA. Originality/value: These findings indicate that frequent EE engagement decreases negative affective states and EE is one of the predictors of decreased L2 listening- and speaking- anxiety and CA. This suggests that EE could play a significant role in L2 learning by enhancing positive affective states. © 2023 The Author(s).

Here, we describe an educational activity that introduces the concept of radioactive decay and the corresponding benefits, risks, and safe handling strategies. Specifically, we have developed an interactive card game, Radioactivity and 235U, as an activity which can be implemented in a fully remote setting without the need for a trained instructor or specific, previously acquired expertise. The card game consists of 72 playing cards and 50 tokens and contains links to two remotely accessible introductory videos on (1) fundamental concepts of radioactive decay and (2) instructions on gameplay. The goal of this activity is to familiarize students with the concepts of radioactive decay, shielding, and applications of radioactive isotopes. Gameplay incentivizes students to prevent, reduce, or limit exposure to a radioactive dose by collecting and using shielding cards, while also learning facts about radioactive isotopes and their stable congeners. The game was tested with undergraduate college students. Pre- and postactivity questionnaires measured the students’ familiarity and opinion on the use and harm of radioactivity. The results indicate that the activity is suitable to introduce basic concepts surrounding radionuclides, radioactive decay, and shielding. We additionally observed a shift in students’ opinions of nuclear chemistry and its role in the world from neutral to slightly positive after the workshop. © 2023 American Chemical Society and Division of Chemical Education, Inc.","Card Game; Nuclear/Radiochemistry; Radiation; Radioactivity Decay; Shielding","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85167819731"

Non-Playable Characters (NPCs), integral to many video games, are computer-generated characters controlled by game algorithms rather than players. Despite their prominence in gaming, research on NPCs’ impact on learners’ perceptions, experiences, and acceptance of DGBL environments remains scarce. This study presents a framework that investigates the impact of non-player characters’ (NPCs) attributes, including social presence, telepresence, social support, and storytelling, on factors related to technology acceptance, such as perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, as well as on the flow state and the intention to continue using a digital game-based learning (DGBL) environment. An experiment was conducted where learners were administered a survey after interacting with NPCs, simulating peers, professors, or industry experts teaching Fintech topics within a DGBL environment. Analysis of 200 valid responses using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling revealed that NPCs’ attributes significantly enhance perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and flow state in the DGBL environment. Furthermore, the findings indicate that perceived ease of use and the flow state positively affect learners’ intentions to continue using the DGBL environment. Thematic analysis per participant feedback highlighted the value of DGBL as an innovative educational approach that makes learning about Fintech accessible and engaging. These results are interpreted through the Technology Acceptance Model, flow theory, presence theory, and gamified learning model, offering insights into how NPCs can be effectively designed to enrich the DGBL learning experience and foster technology adoption. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Digital game-based learning; flow; non-playable characters; presence; social support; storytelling; technology acceptance model","","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85193688530"

Rising interest in video games in combination with gamification techniques make learning fun, easy, and addictive. It is crucial that cybersecurity curricula enhance and expose cybersecurity education to a diversified student body to meet workforce demands. Gamification through cybercompetitions is one method to achieve that. With a vast list of options for competition type, focus areas, learning outcomes, and participant experience levels we need to systematize knowledge of attributes that ameliorate cybercompetitions. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and global lock-downs, competition hosts scrambled to move platforms from local to online infrastructure due to poor interoperability between competition software. We derive a list of takeaways including the lack of interoperability between state-of-the-art competition systems, breaking the high knowledge barrier to participate, addressing competition type diversity, then suggest potential solutions and research questions moving forward. Our paper aims to systematize cybersecurity, access control, and programming competitions by surveying the history of these events. We explore the types of competitions that have been hosted and categorize them based on focus areas related to the InfoSEC Color Wheel.

This study conducted a meta-analysis of 27 empirical studies to examine the effectiveness of game-based learning (GBL) for fostering students’ CT. The effects of various factors on the learning process for acquiring CT were also examined. The results showed that (a) conducting GBL can foster students’ CT, and the overall effect was at the upper-middle level (Hedges’ g =.600, 95% CI [.465,.735], p <.001). (b) Furthermore, conducting GBL can improve students’ CT concepts (Hedges’ g =.916, 95% CI [.410, 1.423], p <.001), CT skills (Hedges’ g =.494, 95% CI [.389,.600], p <.001), and CT perspectives (Hedges’ g =.927, 95% CI [.039, 1.816], p <.05). (c) Additionally, game mode, teaching context, and participant characteristics have positive effects on CT. Based on the findings, it is suggested that using more unplugged games and video games, designing collaborative game activities, and tailoring approaches according to gender difference and programming experience can effectively promote CT. The results have significance for fostering students’ CT in GBL; it is further suggested that instruction processes be rationally designed. © The Author(s) 2023.","computational thinking; game mode; game-based learning; meta-analysis; teaching factors","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85162720208"

However, their use does not always give rise to positive learning, particularly when moral learning is analysed. This result can be explained since video games promote pragmatic goals aimed at success. Therefore, we believe that to facilitate moral learning, it is necessary to promote a moral cognition focus on epistemic goals oriented towards reflection on the actions and events that take place in the game. To identify if epistemic goals can promote moral cognition with a video game, we used Papers, Please. In this game, players take on the role of a customs officer who should face moral dilemmas related to allowing immigrants to cross the border into their country. We analysed the dialogues and decisions made by 12 pairs of students through a category system. The dialogue between players facilitated greater moral activation compared to studies that analysed spontaneous play. In addition, we identified that the game mechanics that promoted moral conflicts between players fostered more moral dialogue. Likewise, when the players empathised with the immigrants, the moral dialogue was more frequent. Therefore, we believe that these characteristics should be considered when designing educational practices using video games to promote moral cognition. © 2023 by the authors.","epistemic play; game-based learning; higher education; moral cognition; scaffolding","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85172078667"

The data in the present study were taken from three different video game genres: Role Playing Game (RPG), Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA), and FPS (First Person Shooter), with two different titles for each genre. The data examined in this study were elements of composition and ten student game players. The compositional features in the collected data from the respective footage of the video games were based on a visual grammar by Kress and Leeuwen (2006) This research utilized the interactive model of qualitative data analysis by Miles, Huberman, and Saldana (2014) in analyzing the compositional features. It consists of three parts: data condensation, data display, and drawing and verifying conclusion. After analyzing the composition, the players were interviewed to gather the vocabulary learned through the process of playing the games. This study found that in terms of composition features: 37 elements of information values, 37 saliences, and 36 framings. It can be concluded that these genres own more maximum disconnection framing than maximum connection. However, these students categorized fighting genre and shooting genre elements without centered information value. The implications of the study towards learning the English language are: in the first place, video games can be one the useful media to teach students reading and speaking literacy skills, especially vocabulary and historical knowledge. Secondly, these games help the players acquire the English language subconsciously and make them enjoy the learning process. © 2024 Sciedu Press.

Using video-cued ethnography and data from the Blinded Study, the authors center three- and four-year-old children who engaged in a collaborative, dynamic make-believe game involving a struggle between family members and los policías (“the police”). Using traditional qualitative methods, the authors first identify and name all the different ways in which the children enacted their agency and demonstrated capabilities in their play, particularly the cultural capabilities that challenge deficit discourses about Latinx immigrant communities. They contextualize the children’s play using teacher interview data in which the teachers explained their thinking behind the pedagogical decisions that made this type of learning and play possible. Finally, the authors explore how the teachers’ identities and histories positioned them to engage with their students in culturally sustaining ways. It is argued that with the growing global awakening to white supremacy structures and violence, there is urgency in creating time and space to support young children’s agency and their right to practice the skills they need to contribute to their communities’ well-being and survival now and in the future. © The Author(s) 2021.","agency; culturally sustaining pedagogy; early childhood education; Latinx immigrant children","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85107328971"

To overcome this, an effective experiential learning integrated with game-based approach that intends to make the learning process fun filled, interesting and enhance the active participation of students to understand complex topics in a simple and optimum manner should be adopted. Objectives: The purpose of this study is to assess the efficiency of a puzzle-based innovation, METAPAD (METAbolic PAthways Decoded) in understanding the complexity of biochemical pathways by enhancing the self-directed learning of students through active engagement in small groups Methods: In this mixed-method study, 103 first professional year medical students in small groups were enrolled for the METAPAD gaming puzzle-based learning activity. The puzzles were integrated with a relevant clinical case study. Decoding the puzzle after identification of the metabolic pathway involved in the case was conducted in level 1,2 and 3 with increasing complexity of puzzles at every level. Following the puzzle activity, A 21-item questionnaire was administered to evaluate the usefulness of the innovation and students’ perceptions towards different learning styles. Also, students’ feedback was obtained through personal interviews for qualitative analysis and thematic analysis was performed. Results: One hundred and three first year undergraduate medical students participated in the study. Most of the students perceived the METAPAD gaming puzzle to be an effective and innovative style of learning. There was not any significant association between age, gender and acceptance towards the METAPAD gaming puzzle. The predominant type of learning style among the students was multimodal (49.5%). Also, there was no great influence of the learning styles on the overall perception towards the METAPAD gaming puzzle. However, learners emphasized the need to focus more while solving the puzzles. Conclusion: Students perceive the METAPAD gaming puzzle as an actively engaging teaching-learning method that enhances their creativity, critical thinking and problem-solving abilities.

This educational emphasis on games provided a unique opportunity to examine how games are actually used in secondary English instruction in combination with other resources. Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate how the digital commercial game This Land is My Land was used alongside a printed novel in naturally occurring English instruction in two lower secondary classes during a two-week project labelled ‘The Native American Experience’. Methods: Participants involved one teacher, nine student teachers and 52 students (aged 13–14). Using a mixed methods design, we integrated quantitative and qualitative analyses of classroom video recordings (N = 20), screen recordings during gameplay (N = 32), student texts (N = 32) and retrospective student interviews (N = 7). We used the validated Protocol for Language Arts Teaching Observation (PLATO; Grossman, 2015) for analyses of video and screen recordings and reflexive thematic analysis (Braun & Clarke, 2022) of student texts and interviews. Results and Conclusions: The combination of digital game and printed novel during English instruction provided a dual perspective on the Native American experience. While the novel provided a window for observing the topic historically, the game provided a playground to experience the topic interactively. Although the combination of game and novel offered students different perspectives on the Native American experience, we identified missed opportunities for those who gamed before reading, whereas students who read before gameplay used their knowledge from the novel when they engaged with the game content.

Despite evolving around scientific concepts, NMS isn’t a serious game, and not all the scientific content in the game is presented with evidence. Theory and Method: Looking at the interceptions between videogames and science, and moving to how science communication, both in theory and practice, can be explored within the videogame’s paradigm, a survey was developed to better understand how NMS players perceive the scientific content in the game. Aims: Are players aware of the scientific content and how it is presented in NMS? Can they decipher it, question it and understand it under real-world rules? With the data collected from 124 respondents from 23 countries, we aim to better understand how an entertainment videogame can potentially help scientists, educators, and science communicators reach a growing, evolving, vibrant, diverse, and demanding audience. Results: Players seem aware of the scientific content in NMS, with a positive attitude through it. But players showed problems identifying what is right and wrong, while also pointing to the idea that every videogame that deals with science should strive to treat it with evidence. 57% of the respondents answered that NMS motivated them to know more about chemistry, with more than 35% revealing that they learned something new and understood the role of some scientific fundaments in certain real-world situations like new energy sources, biomes, or the role of carbon and oxygen. Discussion and Conclusion: With the growth of the videogames’ audience, educators, science communicators, scientists, and policymakers can find in the medium – in any shape or form – a fun and interactive ally to engage with younger audiences and promote dialogues that can be transformative around scientific topics. © The Author(s) 2023.","chemistry; digital games; informal learning; no man’s sky; science communication","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85152394385"

In the field of medicine, realistic simulation and games have risen in popularity, and in turn, gamification has transformed the game elements into a non-gaming world for human engagement like motivation and performance. It is not surprising that game-based learning has branched out in the realm of the medical world. The person’s psychological state determines the effectiveness of education during training. This study aims to examine how the usage of immersive technology impacts users’ tendency to access immersive resources for learning during an emergency like the COVID-19 pandemic. Augmented reality (AR) apps have grown to be a popular tool in education nowadays. The purpose of using AR applications is to impart knowledge during the COVID-19 pandemic. An investigation was conducted to test the effectiveness of immersive technology in learning by developing a game-based experimental model and testing it on 100 non-randomly selected users of various ages. This study shows that users are open to new teaching approaches, including AR applications, in response to the challenges presented by the pandemic. AR applications provide a potential solution to the difficulties associated with education by providing an immersive and interesting experience that enhances learning-based results. This demonstrates that while using AR apps, an individual’s viewpoints and sense of control over their learning are more essential in influencing their conduct. By integrating AR apps into learning systems, immersive education may enhance users’ engagement, motivation and overall learning experiences. Design/methodology/approach: Convenience sampling was chosen as the method for data analysis. One hundred users from a leading private university in the northwest part of India participated in this study. This gave a minimum sample size of 79 participants. To analyse the user experience (UX), a UX questionnaire was adopted. In this research paper, the researcher explores the importance of immersive games that emphasise awareness and experience through a series of questionnaires to assess the effective awareness of COVID through immersive technology, because the immersive element plays a major role in the quality and success of awareness through COVID-19 fighter video games as an interactive learning platform. Findings: Results showed that most people do not know how to deal with an infected person in a critical situation; either they feel scared or deal without taking precautions. COVID-19 fighters are empowered with a virtual patient, which players can interact with. Once the user finishes the FPS game, he must find out the source of viruses that will be an AR-based virtual patient. The first step of the instruction will ask the user to give the mask to the infected person; in the second step, it will ask the user to sanitise his body. In the third step, it will ask to hospitalise. Originality/value: The research offers empirical evidence on the effectiveness of augmented reality-based game approaches to increase reality in basic education to boost the awareness of individuals. The report also gives an example of good cross-cutting education materials that provide the player with a very valuable tool for understanding knowledge of covid awareness by playing the COVID-19 fighter game. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Artificial intelligence; Augmented reality; COVID-19; Immersive games; Video games; Virtual reality","","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85194777341"

This study explored food systems as an alternative pedagogical approach to engage students in nutrition education. METHODS: After playing a food systems computer game, 250 13- to 16-year-old students in 5 Western Australian secondary schools, participated in group discussions to distinguish learning and interests in food systems. Discussion records were thematically coded using constant comparative analysis. RESULTS: Students reported crop growth, food production and food waste, healthier food choices, and food systems as knowledge outcomes of game play. They requested additional content on food production, costing, handling, processing, and accessing local produce. Experiential activities were preferred pedagogical approaches. CONCLUSIONS: Cross-curricular pedagogy which embraces human and planetary health through a food systems lens, can engage adolescents in nutrition education.

Although there is a well-established relationship between tactical knowledge (TK) and tactical behaviours (TB), research has investigated the development of both separately. Thus, the inter-dependency between knowledge and behaviour has been inferred, but not contextually interpreted in a process-oriented analysis of performance. Purpose: Through an insider action-research (AR) design, and adopting a mix-methods approach, this study aimed to: (i) investigate in-depth the influence of a constructivist-ecological pedagogical intervention on developing players’ TK and TB; (ii) explore effects of integrated tactical knowledge and behaviour on competitive performance. Participants and settings: Fifteen female volleyballers participated in this study. An insider-AR (first author assumed the dual role of coach and researcher) was conducted from September 2017 to June 2018. In total, four AR-cycles were completed. A mixed-method approach was used to obtain distinct, but complementary, data on the impact of a constructivist-ecological pedagogical intervention on development of players’ TK and TB. Qualitative data were used to explore the development of TK, while TB was analysed through quantitative methods. Data collection: Qualitative data on the coach’s perceptions were collected using a reflexive diary and field notes, while players’ perceptions were recorded through four semi-structured focus-group interviews, one per AR-cycle. Quantitative data from four official competitive matches, one per AR-cycle, were analysed. Players’ positional coordinates were used to calculate the synchronisation tendencies of lateral blocking and defensive lines through the cluster-phase method. Data analysis: Qualitative data were analysed using thematic analysis, in which inductive procedures deepened understanding of the development of the players’ TK. A 4 (matches) x 1 (court direction) repeated-measures ANOVA was used to analyse quantitatively the differences in the mean cluster-amplitude values of lateral blocking and defensive lines between matches. Main findings: The unique integration of constructivist and ecological principles scaffolded the development of players’ TK and TB. Players evolved from an initial stage in which they verbally described competitive game scenarios (using knowledge about environment), to an endpoint where they revealed superior tactical understanding and action intentionality. Increments in tactical complexity favoured the development of TK and TB in a long-term analysis. However, over the short-term, TB was reduced. The development of players’ TK (supported by interactions yielding knowledge of practice and performance environments) shaped a basis for the acquisition of co-adaptive TB during competitive performance. Practical implications: First, sport practitioners could benefit from combining strategies from different theoretical approaches so that they can satisfy the daily needs of athletes in practice. Second, we advise coaches to adopt didactical and representative learning designs, grounded on video analysis and the co-creation of game-plans. Third, the data imply that time and the continuous exposure of players to meaningful and representative practice tasks in learning environments are needed so that athletes can enrich their tactical behaviours, using knowledge of the performance environment to interact effectively its constraints. © 2022 Association for Physical Education.","constructivism; Ecological dynamics; mix-methods; process-oriented vision; volleyball","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131353571"

This study adopted a quasi-experimental study with a pretest and posttest design. We randomly allocated 44 first-year nursing students at a university nursing school to an experimental group (adopted scenario game-based learning integrated with the experiential learning strategy) (n = 21) or a control group (adopted video-based learning) (n = 23). Before and after the intervention, all students were assessed for their learning performance and 6CCs in labor support. The results showed that the experimental group exhibited significantly better learning performance and 6CCs than the control group, indicating that the integration of a scenario game-based learning with the experiential learning strategy validated a strong impact on nursing students' labor support training.

To that purpose, we are tracing the links between positivist, evaluative paradigms in Digital Game-Based Learning (DGBL) scholarship, arguing that a linear assessment of knowledge transmission does not adequately engage the complexity of virtual worlds and the learning processes they mobilize. As a response, we propose a cyber-ludic pedagogical framework that embeds gamers’ knowledge-production practices and performances in the wider social context they occupy, acknowledging their hybridity as digital and physical experiences. We apply this framework to a case-study reading of a vlog entry performed as a humorous guide to social distancing at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our reading recognizes the operationalization of knowledge communication modes as tropes while emphasizing discrete projects of brand awareness, identity formation, and claims to digital space. Our analysis of the vlog performance of what we term ‘technodeviance’ serves to de-exoticize the deviant in educational research; problematize the assumption of one-way knowledge transmission and representation; and center the pedagogical value of game and play data that is found in popular culture texts and in user-generated content. © 2023, Universidade Estadual de Maringa.

Literature on movement learning and teaching of complex skills has not, to date, focused on karate, and the scarce literature on the learning of elite karate practitioners mostly does not focus on women. Nevertheless, women fighters participated in karate as an Olympic sport, even if such status was temporary, limited to Tokyo 2020 (2021). Purpose: In an analogy with Iris Marion Young's (1980) publication ‘throwing like a girl’, our aim in this study was to investigate what it means to learn ‘to fight like a girl’ and if there is a feminine learned fighting style. Methods: We have carried out an ethnographic project focusing, due to the unexpected impact of COVID-19, mainly on interviewing the female Spanish karate team in preparation for the Olympic Games. We interviewed 14 women athletes of the team and their four male coaches twice each and analysed 28 videos of women athletes displaying their best athletic performances, according to themselves. In this article we are focusing on the analysis of 20 videos of the kumite modality, then reflecting on this analysis with data from interviews of the four coaches and ten of the athletes, the kumite athletes. We developed a series of criteria in order to carry out the task of observation and analysis of the gendered martial-sportive movement supported by the literature, coaches’ perspectives and athletes’ views. The main concepts derived from the video analysis were the use of space, restricted movements; absence of melee work; and difficulty in carrying out projections/sweeps. Findings: Sports karate is still configured as a (hetero)normative environment, supported in tradition, be that of martial art with its pedagogy and of sport as a male preserve. This context leads to a view of women’s learning to perform as inferior to men’s, perpetually comparing them, in the hierarchical structure established within the field. Concepts of equality and equity are undermined, and by performing differently, or not matching the male model, women have their performance of some complex movements qualified as a natural inability. Conclusion: We conclude that there is a feminine way of learning to fight, but only with generalized characteristics since there is a rich plurality of styles among these elite sporting women. For the field, to fight like a girl means inferior performance in comparison with men’s performance, however, for us, it means really ‘to fight’, not just on the mat, and we see such comparison as untenable. © 2022 Association for Physical Education.","elite female sport; Gender; martial arts; video analysis; women’s embodiment","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138789423"

ARG-based education as a form of student-centered learning situates students in a learning environment that integrates virtual elements with physical environments through three-dimensional pictures and videos on mobile devices for educational purposes. To connect the use of digital tools into the language classrooms and allow learners to view the real world, this study examined the viability of ARG-enhanced education on English foreign language (EFL) learners’ learning of giving and asking for directions in flipped and blended contexts. The study involved 60 EFL elementary students of homogenous English proficiency, organized into two comparative and one control group, with 20 participants in each group. For the pre-test, an 18-item multiple-choice test with one written and oral question was administered to assess the learners’ knowledge of asking for and giving directions. After taking the pre-test, the two comparative groups received 16 sessions of ARG-enhanced education (one with a blended and the other with a flipped classroom approach), while the control group received placebo instructions. The flipped group received the instructional materials preceding the online group, while the blended group received instruction in both online and face-to-face classes. The control group received instruction in a face-to-face context. After 8-weeks of treatment sessions, all participants of the study took the post-test. According to the results, both flipped and blended groups receiving ARG-enhanced education performed better than the control group in learning how to give and ask for directions. The results of this study may pave the way for EFL teachers and students to use ARG-based technology in online and traditional classes. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Augmented Reality Games; Blended class; Flipped class; Giving and asking for directions; Learning English; Teaching English; WhatsApp","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85133373948"

However, evidence showed that videos are generally ineffective because they often create extraneous loads due to the information transience and passive processing of information. Purpose: The current study investigates the effects of controlling the display of video on learning outcomes–expressed in terms of recall and transfer scores–and situational interest in physical education settings. Method: 60 tenth-grade students (Mage = 15.90 years, SDage = 1.32 months; 30 boys and 30 girls) were instructed to study using either a continuous video (presented without pauses), a system-controlled video using predefined segments or a self-controlled video where the learner uses ‘stop’ and ‘play’ keys. Then, they were asked to perform the learning tests (i.e. game comprehension test and game performance test) and evaluate the situational interest of the learning materials (i.e. attention demand, challenge, exploration intention, instant enjoyment, novelty). Findings: The results from one-way ANOVAs revealed that students performed significantly better on both recall and transfer post-tests when the video was either system-controlled or self-controlled, which suggested that studying a controlled video could decrease irrelevant cognitive load and so yield better learning performances. Concerning the situational interest variable, students in the self-controlled condition scored significantly higher on almost all dimensions of situational interest. Conclusion: This study indicates that self-controlled video, as applied in this study, can be integrated in a physical education context to foster learning and enhance situational interest. The discussion advances several options for enhancing the effectiveness of instructional videos during physical education lessons. © 2021 Association for Physical Education.","basketball; information transient effect; Pacing; recall; transfer","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85120070782"

However, one-tier tests were mainly adopted in previous GBL, meaning that it was difficult to identify whether students answered questions correctly by understanding knowledge or merely guessed the correct answer. Such tests also make it difficult to provide adequate feedback and guidance during the learning process. In order to solve this problem, a two-tier test-based digital gaming approach (TT-DGA) developed using RPG Maker was proposed in this study. It not only provided students with a more interesting way to learn art and view world-famous artworks in the game, but also introduced a two-tier test in the learning process to help students gradually construct professional art appreciation knowledge. To explore the effects of this approach, a total of 62 university students who took an elective art course were recruited in the current study. A quasi-experimental design was employed and the course was conducted physically during the Covid-19 pandemic. One class was the experimental group which adopted the TT-DGA for learning, while the other class was the control group which adopted the conventional gaming approach (C-DGA). The results showed that the TT-DGA could significantly enhance students’ learning achievement of art appreciation, learning motivation, learning attitudes, and flow experience. Based on the behavioral analysis, students in the experimental group were more active than those in the control group in terms of reading art history materials, watching videos, engaging in tests, and playing the game again. Finally, the interview results uncovered that the two-tier test could help students conduct self-inspection, confirm the accuracy of their understandings of knowledge, and correct misconceptions, and that DGBL made the art course more interesting. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Improving classroom teaching; Interactive learning environments; Pedagogical issues; Teaching/learning strategies","C (programming language); Computer aided instruction; Curricula; E-learning; Learning systems; Motivation; Software testing; Teaching; Art appreciations; Digital gaming; Experimental groups; Game-based Learning; Improving classroom teaching; Interactive learning environment; Learning process; Pedagogical issues; Teaching/learning strategy; Two tiers; Students","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85143751782"

Traditional personality assessment methods often yield unreliable responses, prompting the need for a novel approach utilizing objective data collection through physiological signals. Participants from a Taiwanese university’s Department of Electrical Engineering engaged in a programming video task while wearable sensors captured their physiological signals. A Big Five-factor theory questionnaire was administered to assess their personality traits, and a personality prediction model was developed using the collected data. Results indicated that galvanic skin response and heart rate variance significantly predicted extroversion, while heart rate variance also predicted agreeableness and conscientiousness. These findings hold implications for personalized programming education, enabling educators to tailor pedagogical methods based on students’ personality traits, thereby improving learning outcomes. A case study in a game development elective course demonstrated significantly better performance with personalized materials. By leveraging machine learning and physiological signals, this research presents new opportunities for personalized education, fostering engaging and effective learning environments.

Background: Although substantial research has evaluated the impact of video-based and game-based learning versus traditional teaching approaches, little research has been done comparing the effectiveness of video-based learning and video game-based learning. Furthermore, the few studies that performed this comparison did not compare the effectiveness for online education or examined teacher-authored video games. Research Questions: Is game-based learning using teacher-authored video games more effective than video-based learning in terms of knowledge acquisition for software engineering students in online settings? Is game-based learning using teacher-authored video games more effective than video-based learning in terms of motivation for software engineering students in online settings? Methodology: A quasi-experimental design with control and experimental groups and pre-and post-tests was employed. A total of 180 software engineering students participated in this study, 81 of which belonged to the control group while the other 99 were part of the experimental group. The students in the control group took an online lesson in which they learned exclusively by watching videos, whereas the students in the experimental group took the same lesson but learned exclusively by playing an educational video game created by a teacher through an authoring tool. Findings: The results show that game-based learning using teacher-authored educational video games was more effective than video-based learning in terms of both knowledge acquisition and motivation.  © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Educational games; game-based learning; online education; serious games; software engineering; video-based learning","E-learning; Engineering education; Human computer interaction; Knowledge acquisition; Mergers and acquisitions; Motivation; Online systems; Software engineering; Students; Teaching; Authoring systems; Educational game; Game; Game-based Learning; On-line education; Pandemic; Software; Teachers'; Video-based learning; Video-games; Serious games","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85123703611"

However, the tasks used to study motor practice effects have involved face-To-face assessment, making them difficult to integrate into large internet-based cohorts that represent the next generation of AD research. The purpose of this study was to validate an online computer game against its in-lab version, which has been shown previously to characterize motor practice effects. Materials and Methods: This study leveraged young adult participants within the MindCrowd electronic cohort, a large nationwide cohort for AD research collected entirely through the internet. Validation compared performance on the online version among MindCrowd users against an age-matched cohort's performance on an in-lab version using a different controller (Xbox 360 controller joystick for in-lab sample versus keyboard arrow keys for online sample). Results: Data indicated that the rate of skill acquisition among MindCrowd users were not significantly different from those of the in-lab cohort. Furthermore, the contact-To-consent rate observed in this study (although low) was similar to that of other online AD cohorts. Conclusion: Overall, this study demonstrates that implementing online games designed to study and measure motor practice effects into online research cohorts is feasible and valid. Future research will explore how online game performance is associated with age and dementia risk factors that may help further an understanding of AD. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2023.","Alzheimer's disease; Motor learning; Motor practice; Validation","Alzheimer Disease; Humans; Reproducibility of Results; Task Performance and Analysis; Video Games; Young Adult; Alzheimer disease; human; reproducibility; task performance; video game; young adult","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85152157107"

Popular commercial video games see millions of people around the world immersed in wondrous landscapes, many filled with real geological features including volcanoes, mineral deposits, and dinosaurs. Even though these features can be overlooked by many players as simple video game tropes, if utilized in educational environments or scientific outreach events, video games have the potential to encourage and stimulate teaching of geoscientific concepts, both in the classroom or in their own time. Here, we focus on the geo-educational potential of Pokémon Legends: Arceus, the latest game in the popular Pocket-Monster franchise, Pokémon. Pokémon Legends: Arceus is set in a fictional landscape, Hisui, that is directly based on the real-world island of Hokkaido, northern Japan. Both formal (peer-reviewed literature) and informal (online websites) resources are used to explore in-game and real-world geological feature comparisons and assess the game's educational potential. This paper demonstrates that a single commercial video game can be used to explore a variety of geological and geomorphological concepts including volcanology, economic geology, and hazard mitigation, with direct real-world examples to support the geoscientific understanding. Applications for this study could be extremely useful, not only for increasing interest and facilitating the self-learning of geoscience worldwide, but also for teaching in educational environments. From an educational standpoint, Pokémon Legends: Arceus could be used as a powerful tool to help students engage more in their learning by utilizing their natural affinity to the popular game and showcasing the many geological and geomorphological features found across the landscape of Hisui.

The aim of this descriptive quantitative research was to examine undergraduate students’ perspectives regarding their collaborative creativity experience as game creators for a gamification group assignment within a university-wide elective course on learning disabilities. The Assessment Scale of Creative Collaboration (ASCC) questionnaire was completed by 14 students. The results provide insightful perspectives by undergraduate students regarding their experience in collaborative creativity during game creation. The findings from the closed-ended questions of the ASCC demonstrate that most of the students valued the diversity of knowledge and skills of their team members, shared different ideas, adapted their ideas and practices according to the project difficulties, trusted their team members, co-constructed the game together, overcame conflicts in positive ways, developed multiple versions of their game, and coordinated well for their team project. Data from the open-ended questions of the ASCC, which provided detailed but nuanced perspectives of the students, were analysed thematically. Three main themes were identified: the positive aspects of gamification, the constraints related to the gamification project, and teamwork and collaborative problem-solving approaches. This study provides evidence on the feasibility of game creation that is embedded within gamification group projects for fostering collaborative creativity among undergraduate students. Gamification has the potential in supporting the acquisition of 21st century learning and innovation skills in higher education. Implications of the application of gamification in higher education are discussed. Practitioner Notes 1. This study provides preliminary evidence on the feasibility of making game creation accessible to students. This study also supports educators wishing to embed gamification and game creation by students in the course assessment. 2. The undergraduate students reported positive responses about their game creation experience during the gamification project. However, teamwork could be an issue to be addressed more proactively. In this study, one of the students reported that bad teamwork had affected her gamification project although she felt the gamification was a good pedagogical approach. Thus, facilitators should provide the necessary guidelines on effective collaboration, communication, and teamwork approaches to students early in the semester. 3. Most of the students reported that time limitation was a factor in game creation. None of them had expected that an elective course would be so demanding on their time. A possible reason for the lack of time is the unfamiliarity of students with game creation. Given the promising value of gamification and game creation, we suggest that at the macro level, the university elective course committee could identify how innovative pedagogical approaches could be aligned. Specifically, gamification and game creation could be used more widely across university-wide elective courses to reduce the learning curve involved. At the micro level, instructional videos on gamification and game creation may ease the process of learning about the concept and implementation of gamification and game creation. © 2023, University of Wollongong.

In particular, because most interactions within video games are mediated through visual representations, video games provide opportunities for students to experience disciplinary practices with visual representations. Prior research on learning with visual representations in non-game contexts suggests that visual representations may confuse students if they lack prerequisite representational-competencies. However, it is unclear how this research applies to game environments. To address this gap, we investigated the role of representational-competencies for students’ learning from video games. We first conducted a single-case study of a high-performing undergraduate student playing an astronomy game as an assignment in an astronomy course. We found that this student had difficulties making sense of the visual representations in the game. We interpret these difficulties as indicating a lack of representational-competencies. Further, these difficulties seemed to lead to the student’s inability to relate the game experiences to the content covered in his astronomy course. A second study investigated whether interventions that have proven successful in structured learning environments to support representational-competencies would enhance students’ learning from visual representations in the video game. We randomly assigned 45 students enrolled in an undergraduate course to two conditions. Students either received representational-competency support while playing the astronomy game or they did not receive this support. Results showed no effects of representational-competency supports. This suggests that instructional designs that are effective for representational-competency supports in structured learning environments may not be effective for educational video games. We discuss implications for future research, for designers of educational games, and for educators.

Although vaccination can reduce HPV cancers among men, public health interventions have primarily targeted females. Increased gaming rates among men provide innovative opportunities to motivate behavior change. This study sought to explore which game development and design strategies are most effective in a game for sexual health, specifically focused on HPV. We also sought to capture information relevant to preferred gaming platforms and game mechanics (health messages, avatars, and visual imagery). Materials and Methods: Twenty-two (n = 22) qualitative interviews were conducted with experts. Using grounded theory, interview data was coded, and emergent themes were identified. Results: Game mechanics most mentioned included simulation/role-playing, social interaction, narrative, and rewards. Experts felt it was important to keep the game in the context of the target audience and integrate the game into an existing game/game scenario or application. Experts also felt the game should link to external resources and enlist partnerships or collaborations with external health agencies. Moreover, while there are benefits to each gaming platform, games on mobile phones and tablets are most appropriate. Conclusion: Digital games are a nonconfrontational approach to discussing HPV and can increase knowledge/awareness and positively influence behavior change toward vaccine uptake. Digital games present a safe environment for role-playing through simulated activities without real-world consequences.  © 2022 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.","Game-based learning; Human papillomavirus; Men's health; Public health","Alphapapillomavirus; Female; Humans; Male; Papillomavirus Infections; Papillomavirus Vaccines; Vaccination; Video Games; Human papilloma virus vaccine; Alphapapillomavirus; female; human; male; papillomavirus infection; vaccination; video game","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140275187"

However, the on-site disposal procedures of highway accidents are complex, which makes it difficult for the emergency department to fully observe the accident scene, resulting in the lack of sufficient communication and cooperation between multiple emergency departments, making the rescue efficiency low and wasting valuable rescue time, and causing unnecessary injury or loss of life due to the lack of timely assistance. Thus, this paper proposes a multi-agent-based collaborative emergency-decision-making algorithm for traffic accident on-site disposal. Firstly, based on the analysis and abstraction of highway surveillance videos obtained from the Shaanxi Provincial Highway Administration, this paper constructs an emergency disposal model based on Petri net to simulate the emergency on-site disposal procedures. After transforming the emergency disposal model into a Markov game model and applying it to the multi-agent deep deterministic strategy gradient (MADDPG) algorithm proposed in this paper, the multiple agents can optimize the emergency-decision-making and on-site disposal procedures through interactive learning with the environment. Finally, the proposed algorithm is compared with the typical algorithm and the actual processing procedure in the simulation experiment of an actual Shaanxi highway traffic accident. The results show that the proposed emergency-decision-making method could greatly improve collaboration efficiency among emergency departments and effectively reduce emergency response time. This algorithm is not only superior to other decision-making algorithms such as genetic algorithm (EA), evolutionary strategy (ES), and deep Q network (DQN), but also reduces the disposal processes by 28%, 28%, and 42%, respectively, compared with the actual disposal process in three emergency disposal cases. In summary, with the continuous development of information technology and highway management systems, the multi-agent-based collaborative emergency-decision-making algorithm will contribute to the actual emergency response process and emergency disposal in the future, improving rescue efficiency and ensuring the safety of individuals. © 2023 by the authors.","emergency decision making; Markov game; multi-agent deep reinforcement learning; Petri net; traffic accident; traffic engineering","China; Shaanxi; accident prevention; communication; decision making; genetic algorithm; information technology; machine learning; Markov chain; road traffic; simulation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147983525"

We investigated this question in a game called Physics Playground where we randomly assigned 149 students (Mage = 14, SD = 0.96) to receive learning supports—short videos—either immediately Before (n = 50) or After (n = 46) students worked on solving game levels. We also included a no-support Control (n = 53) condition. We found that students assigned to the two treatment conditions visited fewer game levels, but spent more time per level, and reported lower frustration levels than those assigned to the Control condition. And although students in the After condition had lower in-game performance measures than those in the Control condition, they achieved higher near- and far-transfer scores on the posttest after controlling for gameplay success and pretest scores. Thus, there appears to be some tradeoffs with respect to the inclusion and timing of learning supports. There were no major differences between the treatment conditions regarding learning and subjective measures. The findings of this study can help advance the design of educational games that are intended to enhance students’ learning. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Educational games; Game-based learning; Learning supports; Physics playground","Interactive computer graphics; Timing circuits; Condition; Educational game; Embeddings; Game-based Learning; Learning opportunity; Learning support; Performance measure; Physic playground; Student outcomes; Treatment conditions; Students","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135879067"

This type of violence has grown in recent years, placing the woman not only as a victim of the aggressor but also of a sexist culture established over time. One of the ways to combat this problem is through prevention based on learning and awareness of its causes and damages. The use of 360-degree videos and immersive virtual reality (IVR) combined with serious games (SG) is a promising field of research in the educational field. They have the potential to provide more realistic and engaging environments, enhancing the engagement of their users, thus favoring more learning opportunities. This study presents The Mystery of Pandora, a SG that uses IVR and 360-degree videos to promote knowledge about domestic violence against women (DVAW). The game assessment results suggest a pedagogical potential for promoting knowledge DVAW.

We had three research questions focused on children's game play: 1) How does the structure of each game influence children's play? 2) Do children play more or less independently depending on the game they play? 3) Do children who play the games more independently learn more coding skills? Three researchers coded more than 6 h of video data showing children's play with digital coding games. Findings include, that the type of game did influence the different ways that children behaved while playing. However, during both games, children had the same amount of independent play. Children who played more independently during Daisy the Dinosaur learned more coding skills. This may be because these children were focusing more on the game than their peers as we did not find a similar effect for the game Kodable. We discuss the ways that children play structured vs. open structured (i.e., sandbox) digital games with a particular focus on how game play may influence learning. As opportunities for individual device ownership in classrooms increase, future work should continue to explore how game features influence learning. © 2022","Applications in coding; Cooperative/collaborative learning; early years education; Games","E-learning; Application in coding; Coding skills; Cooperative/ collaborative learning; Digital games; Early year education; Game; Game plays; Learn+; Research questions; Young children; Computer games","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136128845"

In terms of data analysis, the paired sample t-test and ANCOVA were used for within-group and between-group analyses for learning effectiveness and anxiety respectively. The independent sample t-test was used for between-group comparisons of flow, and the two-way mixed ANOVA was used for the comparison of motivation and emotion in the three stages of learning. The results showed that the two game-based learning groups had positive effects on learning effectiveness, flow, and learning anxiety due to the assistance of the scaffolding, while also increasing their positive emotion and decreasing their negative emotion during and after the game. Besides, the mobile scaffolding game-based learning group, with the addition of the dynamic evaluation procedure scaffolding, could enhance learning motivation during the game more than the general game-based learning group, and with the advantage of real-time evaluation, it could reduce the teaching burden of teachers. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","anxiety; educational board game; emotion; flow; Scaffolding","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85171738429"

Little is known on such risks among populations of nursing students and its impact on their empathy skills or trait. Objective: Determining the impact of digital use and internet gaming on empathy of nursing students undergoing remote learning during closure of learning institutions nationwide. Design: Cross-sectional online survey was conducted from October to December 2020. Settings: Two established public institutions located in Malaysia. Participants: A total of 345 nursing students pursuing diploma and bachelor nursing programs. Methods: Toronto Empathy Questionnaire (TEQ), Digital Addiction Scale (DAS) and Internet Gaming Disorder Scale-Short form (IGDS9-SF) were self-administered via Google Form™. Following principal component analysis of TEQ using IBM-SPSS™ (V-27), path analyses was performed using SmartPLS™ (V-3). Results: Despite the increased time spent on digital devices (∆ 2.8 h/day) and internet gaming (∆ 1 h/week) before and during the pandemic, the proportion of high digital users (1.4 %) and gamers (20.9 %) were low; and sizable ≈75 % had higher-than-normal empathy. Digital-related emotions and overuse of them were associated with lower empathy (β = −0.111, −0.192; p values < 0.05) and higher callousness (β = 0.181, 0.131; p values < 0.05); internet gaming addiction predicted callousness (β = 0.265, p < 0.001) but digital dependence correlated with higher empathy (β = 0.172, p = 0.009). Conclusions: Digital and internet gaming addiction potentially impact empathy. The negative impact of digital dependence can be attenuated by “digital empathy” – an emerging phenomenon becoming increasingly vital in digital health and communication. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Digital empathy; E-learning; Empathy; Nursing education","COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Empathy; Humans; Internet; Students, Nursing; Video Games; cross-sectional study; empathy; epidemiology; human; Internet; nursing student; psychology; video game","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138594160"

In the educational context, teachers are using the platform to disseminate personal publications and make them go viral. In this study, multimodal discourse analysis is used, together with grounded theory and the constant comparative method, to understand and interpret the resources and strategies being deployed by teachers to create content. It is found that teachers use different types of affordances of the TikTok platform. In terms of technological affordances, the short video stands out, as well as the ‘selfie shot’ and the teacher’s own voice for representing themself, rather than music or lip-synching. In terms of social affordances, there is trend-following, a casual and optimistic tone, games and humour. In terms of inherited affordances, the whiteboard and marker pen, the centrality of exams or the continued use of the classroom are introduced into the virtual world. This creates tension between these analogisms and their opposite: the ‘Tiktokification’ of the educational space. In the case of certain profiles, the educational purpose is replaced by a move towards personal growth on the internet and the promotion and commercialisation of products, imitating processes typical of influencers. There is also an overexposure of choreographed students, as well as indicators of sexualization of content, in an appropriation of the role of teacher for particular purposes. At the same time, the platform enables the visibility of educational profiles that offer expanded accessibility to very specific and concrete pedagogical content, without this resulting in the implementation of micro-learning strategies or representing a radical break with traditional education. © de los autores","affordances; digital learning; education; online learning; teachers; TikTok","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85188173616"

Technology offers more options for these educational approaches. The goal of this study was to assess health care workers’ experiences, attitudes, and knowledge regarding serious games in training. Methods: The convenience sample consisted of 223 participants from the specialties of internal medicine and psychiatry who responded to questions regarding sociodemographic data, experience, attitudes, and knowledge regarding serious games. This study used an ordinal regression model to analyze the relationship between knowledge, attitudes, and experiences and the idea or wish to implement serious games. Results: The majority of healthcare workers were not familiar with serious games or gamification. The results show gender and age differences regarding familiarity and willingness to use serious games. With increasing age, the respondents preferred conventional and traditional learning methods to playful teaching elements; younger generations were significantly more motivated than older generations when envisioning using elements of serious games in the future. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic has encouraged the use of new technologies and digitalization.

PE is influenced by children’s everyday lives and by changes in society, including the powerful presence of digital technology. However, there is little research on using digital technology in the context of invasion games in primary school PE. The possibility of combining video tagging and the didactic-methodical staging of PE to cover the content of football is investigated in the present study. Purpose: The study aims to (1) investigate student’s perspectives of the emerging role of a camera child (video tagger), and (2) assess how students interact with video products created in a game-based football approach in primary school PE. The focus is on the communication and interaction processes among students. Processes of movement education, general education and media education are all of interest. Method: In six Grade 4 classes in Germany, a football unit was taught over three lessons of 90 min each using the Teaching Games for Understanding method, preceded by one 90-minute media education lesson on various media pedagogical topics. In the lessons, the students were divided into teams of four and presented with football in the context of three-versus-three games. The fourth child on each team took on the camera-child role and tagged important game situations with an app on a tablet. The lessons were then evaluated based on the research approach of focusing on the students’ perspectives. For this purpose, 104 guided interviews with students were conducted and analysed using grounded theory. Findings: Based on the interview analysis, the phenomena that students experienced when using tablets were classified as: (1) ambivalent position of the camera child (with the subcategories of the camera child’s limited influence on the game and limiting and facilitating phenomena for the camera-child role), and (2) conserved and stored movements (with the subcategories of media-supported conflict management and slow-motion distorting reality). The results showed that physical activity was more important to students than using tablets. Conclusion: The use of digital media offers a greater variety of methods and allows children new and expanded access to invasion games like football. In the process, (sports) pedagogical and didactic goals also change and are expanded to include media pedagogical aims. Social learning is also important in this context. In orchestrating digitally enhanced instruction, new opportunities open up in terms of learning and experiencing movement and learning about media and the media products created. © 2023 The Author(s).

People with intellectual disabilities have deficits in intellectual functioning such as attention, reasoning and academic learning. According to the American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, intellectual disability encompasses only a person’s intellectual functioning; however, it can co-exist with other developmental disabilities, such as Down syndrome. People with Down syndrome may have intellectual disabilities in the mild to moderate range. Because of this, they exhibit some cognitive and emotional characteristics of intellectual disability. Among the emotional characteristics of these populations are difficulties in recognizing some emotions, which triggers anxiety and depression problems. The literature proposes using serious video games to support different skills of people with Down syndrome and intellectual disabilities. Some of these works have shown how these serious video games support the development of different skills of these populations. However, they have not been designed to support their emotional awareness. Likewise, technology is aimed at supporting emotion recognition and identification, but most of these have been aimed at other populations, such as people with autism. This paper presents the evaluation process of the design of Emotion4Down: a serious video game to support emotional awareness. We conducted this evaluation in three stages involving people with intellectual disabilities and Down syndrome. © The Author(s) 2023.

In December 2019, a novel coronavirus infection began in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread throughout the world. Since January 2020, the Mongolian government has enforced a social distancing policy, and the country has been one of the few where the disease has not spread. In the 143 days since the outbreak, 575 cases have been reported, resulting in three cases of public emergency preparedness and 50 days of lockdown. The new school year began in September 2021, but due to the Covid-19 pandemic, children will be required to study online from home again on 12th November. It was interesting how the pandemic lockdown affected screen time and physical activity in children. Objective: We aimed to assess the relationship between physical activity (PA) and screen time (ST) of children aged 5-13 years’ Mongolian residents during the COVID-19 lockdown. Methods: The observational cross-sectional study was conducted during the COVID-19 lockdown between 5th Feb and 9th March 2021 which was the second lockdown of Mongolia, and we have studied 1005 children aged 5-13 years from the capital city. The questionnaire was used which was prepared by the study team and the questionnaire included 33 questions to evaluate screen time and physical activity. All parents reported the questionnaire to give some information about their children. We used appropriate statistical methods in SPSS software. Results: A total of 1005 children aged 5-13 years from 628 families were involved in the survey which included 51.9% boys and 44.1% girls. The median of PA and ST was 300 minutes [min, max: 0, 1260] and 30 minutes [min, max: 0,180]. The linear regression revealed a weak negative correlation (r2=0.005, p<0.0001) between PA and ST. When ST and PA analyzed in age by age groups, there was a statistically significant negative dynamic of ST mean time and PA mean score (p<0.0001). Older kids have more ST and lower PA during lockdown time. During this lockdown, 60.4% of the parents reported that their children showed a decrease in PA. Conclusion: The mean score of physical inactivity has decreased and ST increased dramatically among children 5-13 years as a result of the Covid-19 lockdown. © 2023 The Author(s).","COVID-19; IBM; Lockdown; Physical activity; Preparedness; Screen time","adolescent; Article; bedtime; behavior; child; community; coronavirus disease 2019; cross-sectional study; e-learning; education; exercise; female; human; Internet; lockdown; male; Mongolia; observational study; physical activity; physical education; preschool child; quantitative analysis; questionnaire; school child; screen time; sleep pattern; social network; television viewing; traffic and transport; video game","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85178963942"

The purpose of this research study is to discover if immersive VR games can be used as an effective pedagogical tool if blended with traditional lectures by assisting learning gain, memory and knowledge retention while increasing edutainment value. Design/methodology/approach: This research design comprises three different methods of learning: lecture-based involving lecture slides, infographics, and a video, game-based involving an immersive VR game of oil rig exploration, and the combination of lecture and game-based. Participants of each method filled up a questionnaire before and after participation to measure the learning gain, memory, and knowledge retention. Findings: From the predominant findings of the study, the combined method demonstrated a significant increase in learning gain, memory, and knowledge retention and maybe a potentially suitable pedagogical tool. Research limitations/implications: Limitations of the study include findings based on one VR game with a specific educational topic, additionally, it is suspected that having different participants for each of the three methods may have slightly affected the results, albeit to a limited extent. Practical implications: Findings of this study will provide evidence that VR games can be used alongside traditional lectures to aid in the learning process. Educators can choose to include VR games into their curriculums to improve the educational delivery process. Originality/value: This research contributes to ways of incorporating VR games into educational curriculums through findings of this study highlighting the combination of VR games with lectures. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Episodic memory; Immersive; Knowledge retention; Learning gain; Memory retention; Virtual reality game","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85114454786"

While there are several strategies focused on assessing resilience capacity in human communities, there are few strategies focused on fostering resilience thinking. Game-based learning is an active and immersive teaching strategy that can foster complex skills such as resilience. However, this field needs further research in terms of its potential to strengthen community resilience to disasters. In this paper, we validated a serious game to foster community resilience. We present the collaborative creation process for the development of the board game Costa Resiliente, and its subsequent migration into a video game. We have developed an experimental study to evaluate the contributions of the mobile game against the board game. The result is a technological tool based on scientific knowledge to foster resilience thinking in coastal human communities exposed to hazards. The board game was developed using data from local research on community resilience, and from experts in emergency planning and developing games collected in focus groups. The board game’s effect on fostering resilience thinking was validated with school students from a coastal town. During the migration process into a video game, we used a design thinking methodological approach for the co-creation of audiovisual elements, in which beneficiaries participate actively and early. Through this approach, visual and auditory elements that are familiar to coastal communities were integrated into the video game elements. Our study indicates that game-based learning is a useful approach to foster resilience thinking, and that a better gaming experience can be provided by a video game. The potential of this video game for educating young age groups about community resilience is further discussed. © 2022 by the authors.","Chile; co-design; coastal hazard; gamification; resilient thinking","Chile; disaster management; experimental study; hazard assessment; knowledge; learning; strategic approach; teaching","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144914210"

Typically, this fall-term course involves weekly field trips in the Kingston area to visit a variety of rock outcrops to learn and practice methods of field navigation, observation, and measurement. Remote delivery of this course in fall 2020 due to COVID-19, without in-person field trips, required a significant transformation, which included creating field and demonstration instructional videos, using 3D digital photogrammetry models of rock samples and outcrops, developing independent outdoor activities for pace and compass navigation, manual sketching, and graphical measurements on paper, and utilizing a culminating immersive 3D video-game-style geological field mapping exercise. This paper examines these new course elements, how well the course learning objectives were achieved in a remote setting, and the successes and limitations of remote delivery. Although many new virtual elements enhance the course, and some have been incorporated into subsequent in-person offerings, a return to in-person teaching for geological sciences and geological engineering field methods courses is strongly recommended.  © 2022 Jennifer Jane Day.","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145567871"

However, there is still much to investigate if and to what extent video game involvement (VGI) in informal settings can influence students’ language learning motivation (LLM) in formal settings. Adopting a survey methodology with the participation of heavy and frequent video game players, this study examined 100 high school students’ LLM, both instrumental and integrative, and their VGI. The relationship between LLM and VGI was also examined from various angles. Descriptive, inferential statistics and correlation tests were employed for data analysis. The results revealed that the students had moderate LLM, with stronger and statistically significant integrative motivation (z = −3407, p = .001). Despite being negative and weak, VGI in English correlated with LLM (rs = −.355, p < .01), integrative motivation (rs = −.347, p < .01), and instrumental motivation (rs = −.339, p < .01). However, a very strong and statistically significant correlation was found between VGI in English and the time spent doing so (rs =.948, p <.01). A Mann-Whitney U test showed statistically significant difference in both LLM and integrative and instrumental motivation between VGI in Turkish and VGI in English (p <.05). The findings could highlight the significant role of integrative motivation on LLM. The close relationship between VGI in English and the time spent doing so, and also the statistically significant difference between VGI in Turkish and VGI in English, could suggest VGI as an opportunity for learners to interact more easily with English speakers and get to know them more and better. © 2023, Grand Canyon University.

However, since the learning in the online educational environment is predominantly conducted by the learners themselves, problems such as low motivation, low concentration, and low completion rates have been identified. For this paper, we developed a game-based assessment tool that can enhance the learning motivation and concentration and automatically determine if the learning without mind-wandering has been completed; accordingly, we applied it in university classes as part of a verification experiment to investigate the educational usability. The experiment results showed that the game-based assessment tool positively impacted the learning motivation and reduced the learning burden; besides, all of the subjects could enjoy both parts of the game-based assessment tool regardless of his/her learning ability. Finally, a sufficiently high potential was identified regarding the educational usability of the game-based assessment tool. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd. part of Springer Nature.","Gamification; MOOC; Online convergence education; Video-based learning","Computer aided instruction; E-learning; Assessment tool; Convergence educations; Educational environment; Game-Based; Gamification; Learning motivation; Massive open online course; Motivation theories; Online convergence education; Video-based learning; Motivation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85099599278"

The experimental group (i.e. game with L1 glosses in the subtitles) significantly performed better in the post-test and delayed post-test. The findings indicated that L1 glosses helped to enhance noticing and to learn new words. It was clear that adventure games have great potentials for vocabulary learning, and additional lexical supports in gaming can further enhance vocabulary learning. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","adventure games; Digital game-based learning; L1 glosses; learners’ perception; vocabulary learning","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85098569432"

In this research project, university students were asked to interact with a commercial murder mystery video game, Her Story, and produce a piece of creative writing, which was a replication with a new data collection of the original study by Lee (2019). The reason for using this digital game was to provide an authentic learning opportunity for students and analyze whether digital game-based learning facilitates creativity in EFL writing. This replication, involving 25 university students from Poland and 25 university students from Spain, is a media transfer study based on the students transforming one media format (video game) into another (writing). The results demonstrate that the use of a video game with an ambiguous storyline prompts discovery (specific curiosity) and could be the determining factor for producing original, quality ideas in writing even when holding a negative view of one's creativity. The findings also indicate that the choice of genre and a viewpoint in writing may influence the level of elaboration in the texts produced by students.  © The Author(s), 2023.

We recorded and systematically coded the behaviors of using MERs demonstrated by 20 university students during 1.5 hours of gameplay. We conducted both cluster and sequential analyses with a total of 2654 encoded behaviors. The study indicated that the maneuverable visual-spatial representation was most frequently used in the selected architecture game. All of the participants performed a high level of representational transformations, including both treatment and conversion transformations.

Game designers create dedicated tutorials to teach players the game mechanisms and rules, such as the conventions for interaction, control schemes, core game mechanics, etc. While effective tutorial design is considered a crucial aspect to support this learning process, the existing literature approaches focus on designing ad hoc tutorials for specific game genres rather than investigating the impact of different tutorial styles on game learnability and player engagement. In this paper, we tackle this challenge by presenting a general-purpose approach aimed at supporting game designers in the identification of the most suitable tutorial style for a specific genre of video games.

However, there are no studies that identify what aspects are considered more effective to learn with video games and what kind of learning is more accessible using them. This study aims at identifying pre-service teachers’ conceptions regarding video game use for learning and specifically to know what aspects and learning they consider are more feasible. Likewise, we analyzed the pedagogical training effect of these conceptions for three groups of university students: primary pre-service teachers (who received general pedagogical training), secondary pre-service teachers (who received pedagogical training in only one area of knowledge) and other university students without pedagogical training. We applied a questionnaire to a sample of 422 university students. This questionnaire had two dimensions that differentiated between the pragmatic and epistemic uses of video games for learning and three dimensions about the different verbal, procedural and attitudinal learning which can be achieved with them. The results showed wide acceptance of video games as a learning resource in university students, but in particular secondary pre-service teachers pointed out higher possibilities of achieving learning with video games than primary pre-service teachers. On the other hand, university students pointed out more learning when video games were used in an epistemic way. In addition, they considered video games favor more verbal and procedural learnings than attitudinal ones. In conclusion, despite the positive conceptions of the students about learning with video games, we observed a less positive pattern in pre-service teachers with general pedagogical training. These results suggest that video game incorporation in schools is not being carried out fruitfully by education faculties. Therefore, we advocated for 21st-century training that optimized new conceptions and uses of video games. © 2021, The Author(s).","Beliefs; Learning; Questionnaire; Teacher training; University education; Video games","Human computer interaction; Students; Surveys; Belief; Learning; Preservice teachers; Questionnaire; Teacher training; Teachers'; University education; University students; Use of video; Video-games; Personnel training","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85121398622"

Excitation transfer theory, with the limited capacity model of motivated mediated messages, was used to predict that game rewards (administered through goal-directed spatial decision-making demands) will increase hippocampal activity. Activity will remain heightened in a subsequent declarative memory task. It was also predicted that heightened hippocampal activity during encoding will result in better recall after a 25-min delay. Both hypotheses were supported. Participants who played the goal-directed spatial decision-making game experienced greater hippocampal activation during the encoding phase of the memory task. And they demonstrated better recall for the encoded information after the delay. There was also a negative correlation between hippocampal activation and a primary inhibitory neurotransmitter, gamma-aminobutyric acid. These results suggest that goal-directed spatial decision-making mechanics can be important for facilitating hippocampal activation and declarative memory. They stress the need for future research to consider how these mechanics could be implemented in games for learning or as a potential intervention technique for those with memory impairments. © 2023 Hogrefe Publishing GmbH.

The purpose of this study is to analyze how teachers understand the development and teaching of early childhood language in early grades with digital game media and special references for early grade students. Qualitative, interpretative research is employed. The researcher picked a Surabaya primary school with digital technologies for the study’s participants. Eight elementary school teachers were also included in the research. Teachers’ interactions with students while utilizing digital tools were studied via the use of semi-structured surveys and focus group interviews. In addition, it was recorded that bystanders saw these exchanges. The data utilized in this analysis takes into consideration instructors’ perspectives on the value of information communication technology (ICT) in early education, the benefits of digital play, and the potential of digital pedagogy to foster better language acquisition. The study found that instructors were amenable to digital play-based learning. Educators’ knowledge of digital games’ potential to assist primary language learning is limited. Since today’s children are digital natives, many instructors feel video games may help them acquire a second language. More effort should be placed into producing games that incorporate digital language-learning tools. Results also demonstrate that using digital games in the classroom is current. Before completely understanding the benefits of digital play in language instruction, we need further research on teachers’ viewpoints, digital literacy, and behaviors. © 2023,Pegem Egitim ve Ogretim Dergisi.

Portable digital devices are omnipresent and integrated into activities that did not previously require them. The related skills are often referred to as 21st-century skills, constituting a new type of literacy: digital literacy. These devices and skills bring unique, innovative elements to the learning experience; yet, we do not know the extent to which behavior, emotion, and socialization are affected by such experience. For preschool-aged children, interactions with digital devices and games for the purposes of learning can lead to a state of confusion and boredom, an emotional driving force that may generate mind-wandering and exploration, which, in turn, may facilitate learning. Our interdisciplinary observational case study examined the behavioral patterns linked to digital game-based learning (DGBL) by observing how a child’s mind-wandering contributed to iPad use when they were allowed to freely engage with the device and explore independently during the learning process. Building on a previous case study of a 28-month-old boy, “Ryan”, we evaluated the effects of bouts of mind-wandering as he played various DGBL applications (apps) by examining the length of time that Ryan exhibited relevant affective and behavioral states, iPad manipulations, and social interaction during the playtime. Ryan’s interactions with the iPad were video recorded for five weeks, and the video footage was coded using a detailed rubric. The results indicated that negative emotions, such as boredom, distraction, and confusion, if coupled with attentiveness and persistence, led to positive mind-wandering and positive learning outcomes. However, when boredom was coupled with frustration, it led to negative mind-wandering and a lack of learning outcomes.

Specifically, because most interactions within video games are mediated through visual representations, video games provide opportunities for students to experience disciplinary practices with visuals. Research demonstrates, however, that learning from multiple visuals is complex. Prior research in structured environments has demonstrated that providing supports for representational competencies in terms of sense-making competencies and perceptual fluency can support learners, but such research has not been conducted in game environments. To address this gap, we investigated whether supports for representational competencies enhanced students' learning with an astronomy video game. We conducted an experiment with 115 students to investigate the effects of sense-making support (yes vs. no) and perceptual-fluency support (yes vs. no) within an astronomy game. Results showed that sense-making supports did not enhance students' content learning. Further, perceptual-fluency supports enhanced students' content learning outcomes only when they had high content pre-test scores. Hence, interventions that support representational competencies in non-game environments may work differently in the context of educational video games. This suggests that designers may need to develop new strategies to support students’ learning with disciplinary visuals in educational games. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Astronomy; Educational video games; Representational competencies; Sense-making","Human computer interaction; Interactive computer graphics; Educational video games; Game environment; High-content; Learning outcome; Representational competency; Sense making; Structured environment; Student learning; Video-games; Visual representations; Students","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136453469"

It can usually be carried out through video-based flipped learning (FL) within a web-based learning environment. However, we found that residents lack the process of reflection, blindly imitating results in losing interest and passion for learning in the traditional teaching pattern. The teaching method of ""spot the difference"" (SDTM), which is based on the fundamentals of the popular game of ""spot the difference,"" is designed to improve students' participation and reflective learning during skill training. This study aimed to evaluate this novel educational model's short-term and long-term effectiveness for surgical residents in China. Methods: First-year residents who required a three-month rotation in the head and neck surgery department were recruited to participate in a series of CSTs. They were randomized into SDTM and traditional FL (control) groups. Clinical skill performance was assessed with validated clinical skill scoring criteria. Evaluations were conducted by comparing the scores that contain departmental rotation skill examinations and the first China medical licensing examination (CMLE) performance on practical skills. In addition, two-way subjective evaluations were also implemented as a reference for the training results. Training effects were assessed using t tests, Mann–Whitney–Wilcoxon tests, chi-square tests, and Cohen’ s effect size (d). The Cohen’ s d value was considered to be small (<0.2), medium (0.2-0.8), or large (>0.8). Results: The SDTM group was significantly superior to the control group in terms of after-department skill examination (t=2.179, p<0.05, d=0.5), taking medical history (t=2.665, p<0.05, d=0.59), and CMLE performance on practical skill (t=2.103, p<0.05, d=0.47). The SDTM members rated the curriculum more highly than the control on the items relating to interestingness and participation (p < 0.05) with large effect sizes (d >0.8). There were no significant differences between the two groups on clinical competence (t=0.819, p=0.415, d=0.18), the first-time pass rate for CMLE (χ2 =1.663, p=0.197, d=0.29), and short-term operational skills improvement (t=1.747, p=0.084, d=0.39). Conclusions: SDTM may be an effective method for enhancing residents' clinical skills, and the effect is significant both short- and long-term. The improvement effect seemed to be more significant in the peer-involved SDTM than training alone. However, despite positive objective results, SDTM still risks student learning burnout.

We conducted a design-based research project in a culturally and linguistically diverse Canadian school. Our video analysis identified embodied discourses wherein a student with limited English language proficiency came to be a designer of a board game, while meaningfully engaging in mathematics learning.

This need includes CPD aimed at impacting student motivation. Existing CPD on teachers’ motivating style often takes the form of singular events such as a workshop or training session. Research shows that in general, this only has a small impact on teacher behaviour and the effects on student motivation have not received much attention. Lesson study is a popular and more extensive form of CPD in which teachers collaborate on lesson planning, delivery and evaluation, based on predetermined goals for student learning. It has been suggested that this approach could enhance the effectiveness of CPD, but few studies have actually examined this at the level of teacher behaviour and student outcomes, especially in physical education. Aim: The present study aims to contribute to the knowledge base of effective CPD within physical education. It investigated whether a lesson study follow-up to a traditional workshop approach would increase the effectiveness of a CPD programme on motivating teacher behaviour, student-perceived motivational climate and student motivation for physical education lessons, from the perspectives of Achievement Goal Theory and Self-Determination Theory. Methods: Ten secondary school PE-departments were included in the workshop + lesson study intervention group (LS), whilst nine served as a control group that received a workshop only (WS). A total of 52 PE teachers (33 LS and 19 WS) and their 612 students (334 LS and 278 WS) participated in the study. Measurements were taken two weeks prior to the start of the CPD programme (pre-test), and again two to three weeks after the CPD had ended (post-test). Two teachers per school were randomly chosen for pre and post measurements in their games-lessons. Lessons were video-recorded and observed using previously validated observation instruments measuring autonomy support, structure, relatedness support, mastery climate and performance climate. Students completed questionnaires on their motivational regulation, basic needs satisfaction and achievement goal orientation during both pre and post measurements. Results: In terms of observed teacher behaviours, there was a significant, large increase in teachers’ provision of autonomy-support and a trend for a medium increase in teachers’ provision of structure from pre to post in both conditions, whereas teachers’ employment of a performance climate decreased in both groups. There was, however, no significant difference in effect between both conditions. At the student level, there was a small but significant decrease in students’ performance approach orientation (PAp), with PAp decreasing more in LS than WS. Changes for all other student-derived variables from pre to post were negligible. Conclusion: Researcher observations showed that both CPD approaches, the workshop followed up with lesson study and the stand-alone workshop, were equally effective in positively altering the motivating behaviour of PE teachers. However, there was no substantial impact on student-perceived motivational climate and student motivation. Therefore, in the manner enacted in the present study, lesson study cannot be recommended as an effective and efficient form of CPD. © 2021 Association for Physical Education.","continuing professional development; lesson study; motivation; Physical education","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85111700923"

For the purpose of the study, there were a total of 84 fifth-grade kids from public schools in Greece, who participated. These students were split up into three different experimental groups and a control one. Participants in the experimental groups read throughout the treatment period according to a preset schedule using one of three diverse electronic reading formats (PDF, gamified, or customized), whilst participants in the control group read utilizing a paper guided reading plan. The participants' experiences playing video games online were analyzed via a technique called the quasi-experimental approach. According to the findings of the research, the experimental group and the control group did not significantly vary from one another in terms of their levels of reading comprehension. On the other hand, in comparison to the participants in the control group, those who took part in the experiments reported having more favorable sentiments regarding their electronic reading experiences and were more inspired to read. As indicated from the research findings, kids may experience an increase in their desire to read when they use electronic gadgets.

Informal learning may promote the self-determination transition-age autistic youth need to overcome and/or transform these barriers. This report focuses on the iterative process of developing video game design workshops guided by feedback from autistic students about instructional strategies they found engaging. This study is part of a three-year-long NSF-funded program of research that seeks to empower autistic youth to move toward successful careers by teaching educators how to more effectively guide them. Methods: In the Summer of 2021, educators at an award-winning NYC-based, not-for-profit, education program, Tech Kids Unlimited (TKU) collaborated with researchers, including autistic students, to iteratively develop and assess two online game design workshops for transition-age autistic youth. Participants selected which workshop they were available for (Workshop 1: n = 18; M age = 16.72 years; Workshop 2: n = 16; M age = 16.56 years). Students in Workshop 2 had more varied support needs and were less motivated to learn video game design than students in Workshop 1. Students completed assessments before and after each workshop and rated their interest in specific workshop activities after each activity. Guided by data from Workshop 1, we revised instructional strategies before conducting Workshop 2. Results: We found little evidence for our hypothesis that attentional style would impact educational engagement. However, video game design self-efficacy and self-determination were often positively associated with engagement. Two industry speakers, one of whom was autistic, were among the highest-rated activities. As hypothesized, video game design self-efficacy and self-determination (and unexpectedly) spatial planning improved from pre- to post-test following Workshop 1. Despite our efforts to use what we learned in Workshop 1 to improve in Workshop 2, Workshop 2 did not lead to significant improvements in outcomes. However, students highlighted instructional strategies as a strength of Workshop 2 more often than they had for Workshop 1.

Discussion: Findings suggest that interactive multimodal activities, stimulating discussions, and opportunities to engage with neurodivergent industry professionals may engage and empower diverse autistic youth.

Previous research has focused on measures of reaction time and practice under externally cued conditions to decipher the motor learning abilities of persons who stutter. Without the confounds of extraneous demands and sensorimotor processing, we investigated motor sequence learning under conditions of explicit awareness and focused practice among adults with persistent development stuttering. Across two consecutive practice sessions, 18 adults who stutter (AWS) and 18 adults who do not stutter (ANS) performed the finger-to-thumb opposition sequencing (FOS) task. Both groups demonstrated significant within-session performance improvements, as evidenced by fast on-line learning of finger sequences on day one. Additionally, neither participant group showed deterioration of their learning gains the following day, indicating a relative stabilization of finger sequencing performance during the off-line period. These findings suggest that under explicit and focused conditions, early motor learning gains and their short-term retention do not differ between AWS and ANS. Additional factors influencing motor sequencing performance, such as task complexity and saturation of learning, are also considered. Further research into explicit motor learning and its generalization following extended practice and follow-up in persons who stutter is warranted. The potential benefits of motor practice generalizability among individuals who stutter and its relevance to supporting treatment outcomes are suggested as future areas of investigation. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","Consolidation; Finger opposition sequencing; Motor learning; Stuttering","Adult; Humans; Learning; Motor Skills; Reaction Time; Speech; Stuttering; accuracy; adult; Article; attention; awareness; childhood; clinical article; continuous performance test; controlled study; correlation coefficient; deterioration; e-learning; female; finger to thumb opposition sequencing; follow up; human; male; motor learning; musical instrument; onset age; predictive value; questionnaire; sequence learning; sequencing error; short term memory; stuttering; sustained attention; task performance; treatment outcome; video game; Wechsler adult intelligence scale; working memory; learning; motor performance; reaction time; speech; stuttering","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147202629"

We employ technology-enhanced training effectiveness model to investigate the impact of students’ prior experiences, expectations, and attitudes on their reactions to training. The obtained results bring several novel insights on the role of these factors, including a negative (rather than positive) impact of experience with video games on expectations regarding the app or a small (rather than large) positive impact of experience with video games on reactions to training.

Research has demonstrated that digital game making can provide a powerful means of engaging learners by leveraging the popularity of video games and can be particularly effective at engaging the unengaged, including those with learning difficulties. Past work has tended to focus on smaller scale, specific evaluations and not examined the potential of digital game making in subject based teaching in real settings. This work seeks to address this gap by defining a digital game making intervention that utilises game templates to teach United Kingdom based curriculum topics. Four schools were recruited who provided seven classes of students (N = 157) to take part in the study; these included mixed ability classes and two classes comprised of learners with Special Education Needs and Disabilities. In conjunction with teachers, digital game making sessions were scaffolded around game templates. These were implemented into teaching practice to deliver a curriculum topic taught over an eight-week period. An evaluation strategy was developed that utilised a mixed methods approach to evaluate learner engagement, collaboration and inclusion across sessions. This included quantitative data captured using an in-class observation tool, and teacher interviews yielding qualitative data analysed using Thematic Analysis. This paper provides an initial exploration and evidence that digital game making can be used to teach a number of topics outside of computing. Findings from analysed data demonstrate that such approaches provide more engaging and inclusive learning experiences in the classroom. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Digital game making; Educational games; Evaluation studies","Computer games; E-learning; Human computer interaction; Interactive computer graphics; Learning systems; Classroom teaching; Delivery methods; Digital game making; Digital games; Educational game; Evaluation study; Learning difficulties; Small scale; Teachers'; Video-games; Curricula","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85160815253"

Most studies have measured self-rated impact of gambling advertising using questionnaires. Given that gambling advertisements come in different forms such as print media/television advertising and contain variable content, it is difficult to understand using subjective measures which aspects of the gambling advertisements increase craving and desire to trigger a gambling session. In the present study, we applied a novel data-driven methodology that directly tracks eye movements to reveal attentional biases towards gambling adverts and promotions by examining differences in young people's eye gaze behaviour when watching gambling and non-gambling (control) moving adverts. Method: A total of 98 (16-18 years old) children who self-identify as having a low or high craving to gambling watched gambling and non-gambling (control) television adverts, while their eye movements were recorded. Results: The results show that the data-driven method can isolate video clips that best distinguish people on the low-high craving spectrum, reveal the type of each video clip with the largest group differences, and accurately predict young people's gambling craving on the basis of eye movement patterns. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that young people's craving for gambling can be predicted based on their eye movements to video clips of gambling advertisements and that certain features of gambling advertisements may be more appealing to some group of viewers, particularly those with high craving for gambling. © 2023 The Author(s).

Increasingly, there has been a call to involve students in real-world experiences through projects that explore authentic issues using technology. Game design-based learning with its unique set of affordances may offer a path to integrating technology, computer science education, creativity, and problem-solving. Increasingly, the ability to create rather than just consume technology has gained attention linking creativity and collaboration to using coding language. In this study, data collection included student reflection journals, classroom observations, classroom video recordings, a focus group interview, and students’ games. Participants came from two GT classes (n = 45). Qualitative analysis identified five themes: overcoming challenges of group work, developing a culture of collaboration, creating narrative, and connecting science, problem-solving in Scratch’s coding environment, and reflecting on learning. Findings indicated involving gifted students in game design-based learning in science had a positive impact on student perceptions of problem-solving, creativity, and collaboration. © The Author(s) 2023.","coding; computer science education; digital game-based learning; gifted and talented students","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85150074955"

With this objective in mind, we conducted a systematic literature review on serious games in the learning of primary-school students to reveal the advantages and the disadvantages, as well as the effects of educational game strategies and in the application areas, when using the PRISMA methodology to analyse the academic progress during the last 10 years. We conducted the search, selection and analysis in different databases, such as SCOPUS, ERIC and Dimensions, and analysed 54 studies. The results showed that serious games have a positive impact on cognition; and they generate significant learning achievements. Likewise, the game-based learning strategy concentrates a high level of motivation, generated by the interest, commitment and fun to solve the activities. However, it was also noted that the competition among students to reach the highest competencies can increase the level of anxiety. In addition, inadequate methodology and teacher unfamiliarity can cause negative effects, such as apathy towards serious games. Regarding the intervention areas, a greater application was observed in mathematics, the social sciences, communication and natural sciences. On the other hand, mathematical and communicative skills are the most addressed topics. © 2023 Society for Research and Knowledge Management.

Fifty-two adolescent female students were divided into a verbal encouragement group (VEG, 15.57 ± 0.50 years) and a contrast group (CG, 15.50 ± 0.51 years). Anthropometric measurements, soccer-specific cardiorespiratory endurance (Yo-Yo Intermittent Recovery Test Level 1; YYIRT1), muscle power (countermovement jump (CMJ); 5-jump-test (5JT), agility (t-test), sprint speed (30 m)), technical skill, and heart rate (HR) responses during SSG were measured. Additionally, heart rate (HR) was recorded throughout the SSG, and video analysis was used to quantify technical actions. The independent samples Student’s t-test was used to compare the difference between the verbal encouragement group and the CG. There was no difference between the verbal encouragement group and the CG in anthropometric characteristics and 30 m speed (p > 0.05). The total distance measured with YO-YOIRT level 1, t-test performance, CMJ, and 5JT performance results of the verbal encouragement group were considerably higher than the CG (p = 0.001, ES = 1.8, large; p = 0.001, ES = 1.09, large; and p = 0.001, ES = 1.15, large, respectively). Furthermore, the ball contacts, successful balls, and average heart rate were higher in the verbal encouragement group compared with the CG (p = 0.001, ES = 3.69, large; p = 0.001, ES = 5.25, large; and p = 0.001, ES = 5.14, large, respectively).

In a within-subjects design, boys (N = 56; aged 12–16 years) performed a pain judgment task before and immediately after playing a violent video game. In this task, participants judged whether photos of hands depicted on their screen were in a painful situation or not. While both the P3 and the LPP components were not related to habitual violent video game exposure, general exposure to antisocial media content predicted lower P3 amplitudes to painful pictures. Further, 40 min of violent gameplay did not affect the P3 responses; however, it temporarily decreased LPP responses to painful pictures, suggesting a modest short-term desensitization effect. However, this latter interpretation is limited by a strong LPP pain effect–a significant amplitude difference between painful and non-painful pictures–that remained present in the post-game condition. Such persistent LPP effect may relate to the notion that adolescents are still learning how to properly regulate their emotional reactions. This study contributes to the limited literature on violent video games’ desensitization in adolescents’ brains, opening new avenues for media violence research. © 2023 The Author(s).

The main premise of this paper is that game-based learning is inherently more suitable for language learning than a traditional classroom, since it is based on the concept of playfulness, which is an integral part of the personalities of virtually all learners and especially young learners. Therefore game-based learning can be used to remove the linearity and negative predictability of the traditional classroom paradigm and introduce a novel way of teaching students in Montenegro. Another benefit of game-based learning is that it can be applied to just about any subject in our schools and faculties with the caveat of first implementing appropriate adjustments to the curriculum design depending on the specific nature of the subject in question. First, we will introduce the concept of GBL, then provide an overview of the overall theories this paper is based on and introduce the outcomes of our GBL study with a game called Portal 2 and show how game-based learning can be practically applied to foreign language teaching and learning. Our study was designed to function as longitudinal research containing the Target and two Control groups with the aim of investigating whether game-based learning can be an effective tool for foreign language learning. We found that GBL may provide an interactive and engaging environment that encourages active participation and immersion in the language, which helps learners develop their communication, vocabulary, grammar, and cultural awareness skills in a fun and motivating way. © 2023 University of Montenegro.

The study employed a quasi-experimental design with a control group and an experimental group. Initially, both groups studied a target vocabulary list of 20 words and their definitions. The participants were asked to complete a multiple-choice definition matching test after studying the list to find out whether their levels of vocabulary knowledge were comparable prior to the applications. For the experimental group, a second vocabulary test equivalent to the first one was conducted after they read a novel extract including the target vocabulary items, and a third test was carried out after they watched two computer game cutscenes that were based on the same events as the novel extract to understand whether seeing the target vocabulary items in these contexts repetitively would result in a significant increase in their target vocabulary knowledge. For the control group, the second and the third vocabulary tests were undertaken immediately after the first one to investigate whether mere exposure to equivalent vocabulary tests without the interventions would lead to a significant increase in their target vocabulary knowledge. The findings of the study indicated that the scores of the participants in the experimental group increased descriptively on the second test and significantly on the third test, whereas the scores of the participants in the control group decreased significantly on the second test and descriptively on the third test.

The generation of virtual univer-ses in which the physical and the digital converge raises the question of how education will be addressed in these new systems. We find, however, pioneering exercises such as Minecraft: Education Edition. This platform is a version based on the popular sandbox video game, which was originally created by a community of teachers. The aim of this research is to analyze and describe the idiosyncratic characteristics of Minecraft as an educational platform, framing it as one of the pioneering exercises in the metaverse. To this end, we have employed a methodology that combines Multimodal Discourse Analysis with Grounded Theory and the Constant Comparative Method. As conclusions, we observe how the Minecraft Education platform reinforces from its approach pre-existing aspects from the physical world, resizing them to adapt them to its connected digital environment. These are key elements such as the identity of the participants, their ability to act within the system, creativity through lessons as a guide to the educational objectives and the community as the backbone of the process. At the same time, it presents differential components, such as the use of avatars, the transition from textual literacy to multimodal literacy, game mechanics that boost creativity or transhuman capabilities that defy physical space-time. All in all, the platform is designed for teachers, parents and managers, to whom it offers a series of benefits. Therefore, the pedagogical action will depend on their judgment and execution, especially through the elaboration of lessons and worlds, the management of the sessions and their interaction in community environ-ments. It is their responsibility to ensure that the educational experience is truly empowering or, on the contrary, that it ends up being governed by reproductive criteria linked to symbolic violence. © 2022, El Profesional de la Informacion.

This study examined teachers’ perceptions of the language learning affordances, challenges, and benefits in the early English classroom (ages 7–11) of English learnt outside school (extramural English (EE), Sundqvist & Sylvén, 2016). A mixed-methods approach, including a survey, interviews, and data from Facebook interest groups on teaching English, was used to gauge teacher perceptions. Results showed that generally teachers had positive attitudes towards the learning potentials of EE (especially related to fostering vocabulary learning) and for creating motivation for learning English. Teachers found less benefits of playing digital games than from watching YouTube videos. Teachers also reported demotivation in students stemming from being bored in class or from feeling behind compared to others, i.e., personal expectations of English skills were high. The study points to a need for focus in teacher education on the benefits of extramural activities for their students’ learning (especially gaming). This means fostering awareness in prospective teachers of the importance of incidental learning processes as these are key in the global English context. Moreover, sharing ideas for integrating EE into teaching practices is needed. © 2023 John Benjamins.","extramural English; second language learning; young learners","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85167996414"

However, close proximity and physical contact between students are often considered ‘normal’ during physical education (PE) classes, making it challenging for PE teachers to ensure physical distancing. Objectives: The aim of this study was to assess the effect of the implementation of the Good Behaviour Game (GBG) in maintaining physical distancing in PE settings in times of the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: In a quasi-experimental design, two groups were separately designated as an experimental group (20 classes involving 220 students) and a control group (20 classes involving 231 students). They were all enrolled in the eighth grade of the Tunisian education system. In the experimental group, the PE teacher managed physical distancing by administering the GBG. Physical distancing was evaluated by direct observation of videos of filmed PE sessions using a code grid. It was measured twice for the two groups using Kinovea software. Results: Quantitative data analyses showed that the level of maintaining physical distancing increased after the GBG intervention in the experimental group (p <.001). Furthermore, greater percent changes between pre- and post-intervention were identified in the experimental group compared to the control group (120% vs 1%, respectively). Conclusion: The GBG was effective in ensuring students’ physical distancing when implemented in PE settings. © The Author(s) 2023.","Game-based learning; Good Behaviour Game; physical education; social distancing; Tunisia","adult; analysis of variance; Article; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; data analysis; education; experimental design; female; game-based learning; human; information processing; learning; major clinical study; male; pandemic; physical activity; physical education; physical performance; post hoc analysis; prevalence; quantitative analysis; social distancing; teacher; training; Tunisia; Tunisian","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146534809"

However, little systematic knowledge exists on the nature of these practices, the tools used, and the families’ views regarding digital media use for language learning. This article addresses this knowledge gap, presenting the results of an online survey conducted among 209 parents of transnational, multilingual families from Luxembourg. The questionnaire, which included closed- and open-ended questions, investigated the use of digital media among family members, the tools and activities employed and parental views towards the use of digital media for language learning. Parental reports suggest that children and adults may engage in different practices when learning languages with digital media. Digital tools most frequently used by the families in our studies include educational apps, videos, and online games. Further, our results indicate that parents assess digital media use for language learning positively, emphasising their accessibility and usefulness for the development of language skills. At the same time, the open comments indicate concerns related to the children’s age and the appropriateness of the available materials. The ensuing discussion and conclusions place the survey results in the context of existing literature and outline areas for future research. © 2023 The Author(s).

Other than language learning, these courses are also designed to develop cognitive skills. One of these is metacognition, which concerns an individual’s cognitive capabilities to plan, execute, monitor and evaluate tasks, and that needs to be developed and strengthened at tertiary levels of education prior to embarking on a career. To that end, a digital simulation game was introduced as supplementary material for an ESP (Business English) class during a semester, with the aim of facilitating and developing metacognitive awareness and strategy use as well as foster incidental language learning. This qualitative case-study explores the learners’ experiences with using the digital simulation video game The Sims 4: Get to Work (Retail) to support their learning of Business English and develop their metacognition. Findings revealed that learners displayed declarative knowledge, procedural knowledge, and conditional knowledge of metacognitive processes during the game play, and indicated ability to regulate their cognitive processes to achieve the business goals of the retail simulation game, while using Business English. Implications of these findings suggest that the implementation of simulation game-based learning is highly beneficial for students, enabling them to develop both their metacognitive skills and communication within ESP contexts. © (2023), (UiTM Press).

Yet, while we have discovered much about human biases in specific learning domains, much of this research has focused on simple tasks that lack the complexity of the real world. In contrast, video games involving agents and objects embedded in richly structured systems provide an experimentally tractable proxy for real-world complexity. Recent work has suggested that key aspects of human learning in domains like video games can be captured by model-based reinforcement learning (RL) with object-oriented relational models—what we term theory-based RL. Restricting the model class in this way provides an inductive bias that dramatically increases learning efficiency, but in this paper we show that humans employ a stronger set of biases in addition to syntactic constraints on the structure of theories. In particular, we catalog a set of semantic biases that constrain the content of theories. Building these semantic biases into a theory-based RL system produces more human-like learning in video game environments. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","AI; Cognitive science; Inductive bias; Learning; Psychology","Bias; Humans; Learning; Reinforcement, Psychology; Semantics; Video Games; human; learning; semantics; statistical bias; video game","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138513135"

Predictions are typically based on unsupervised or supervised learning, often leveraging simple yet effective graph topological information, such as the number of common neighbors. However, we argue that richer information about personal social structure of individuals might lead to better predictions. In this article, we propose to leverage well-established social cognitive theories to improve link prediction performance. According to these theories, individuals arrange their social relationships along, on average, five concentric circles of decreasing intimacy. We postulate that relationships in different circles have different importance in predicting new links. To validate this claim, we focus on popular feature extraction prediction algorithms (both unsupervised and supervised) and we extend them to include social circles' awareness. We validate the prediction performance of these circle-aware algorithms against several benchmarks (including their baseline versions as well as node-embedding- and graph neural network (GNN)-based link prediction), leveraging two Twitter datasets comprising a community of video gamers and generic users. We show that social awareness generally provides significant improvements in prediction performance, beating also state-of-the-art solutions such as node2vec and learning from Subgraphs, Embeddings and Attributes for Link prediction (SEAL), and without increasing the computational complexity. Finally, we show that social awareness can be used in place of using a classifier (which may be costly or impractical) for targeting a specific category of users.  © 2014 IEEE.","Dunbar's model; link prediction; social circles; Twitter","Benchmarking; Blogs; Extraction; Forecasting; Multilayer neural networks; Network embeddings; Network layers; Social networking (online); Dunbar model; Features extraction; Link prediction; Prediction algorithms; Prediction performance; Predictive models; Representation learning; Social circles; Social networking (online); Twitter.; Feature extraction","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85126559103"

This study introduces and evaluates a curriculum enrichment programme aimed at enhancing creativity. The programme is based on a competency framework and was implemented using variations of Project-Based Learning (PBL) strategies. Method: A quasi-experimental design compared two interventions using pre-test and post-test groups. The first intervention (N = 38) involved a 12-week PBL unit focused on designing a video game using block-based programming through Scratch. The second intervention (N = 51), also lasting 12 weeks, comprised three separate projects involving vectorial design and programming of an Arduino-based robot. Both interventions used strategies for creative-thinking development. The sample included high-ability students from 8 to 12 years of age. Results: Both interventions significantly increased creativity, with no statistical differences between them. This suggests that both types of PBL interventions effectively improved participants’ creativity.

Gamification tools are increasingly being implemented in education, since previous studies have demonstrated their usefulness to foster motivation, particularly in the case of engineering students. For that reason, there is a great need to continue providing empirical evidence of experiences proving the positive consequences of new active learning tools. In this work, a video-game (which would be catalogued as a serious game in the literature) was implemented in a subject traditionally perceived by the students as very complex, at the School of Engineering in Cádiz (Spain). The purpose of the video-game was to provide an entertaining way to review the theoretical concepts taught during the lessons. Since the video-game was successful, another one was developed with the same environment but the theoretical contents of another part of the subject. After implementing the first game, which was played by N = 311 students, 94% of them stated that the game increased their motivation in the subject, and also that the games were very easy to use, very helpful to review the subject and enjoyable. Also, the students who played the games obtained a higher performance compared to the rest (around + 36% higher passing rates). Last of all, a t-student analysis revealed that the mean differences between the exam scores obtained by students who played the games and the exam scores of those who did not play were significant for both games. The impact of gender was also investigated, showing that gender had a small influence on the rating given to the games. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Engineering; Game-based learning; Gamification; Serious-games; Video-games","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137460117"

Though detrimental outcomes of negative game factors have been demonstrated across previous studies, the effects of prevalently-exist positive game factors, for example, prosociality and cooperation, remain unclear. This study examined the effects of positive game factors in violent video games on aggressive behavior by exploring prosociality and cooperation. Based on the General Learning Model, Experiment 1 examined the effect of prosociality on aggressive behavior and the mediating role of perceived violence in the game. Experiment 2 examined the relation between cooperation in violent video games and aggressive behavior, the mediating role of hostile interpretation bias, and the moderating role of the game result. The results of Experiment 1 showed that prosociality did not influence aggressive behavior. The results of Experiment 2 showed that cooperation decreased aggressive behavior. Additionally, Experiment 2 also found that the hostile interpretation bias mediated the relation between cooperation and aggressive behavior, and win/lose results moderate the relationship between cooperation and aggressive behavior. Considering the questions raised by post hoc sensitivity analysis, future studies could investigate the effects of positive game factors in violent video games on aggressive behavior with a larger sample size. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145034872"

They play an important role in many teenagers' lives and, for that reason, have also lately received more attention in the context of school education, including English language education. Yet, while English language research continuously points out the great potential of video games for language learning, they have hardly found their way into actual English as a foreign language (EFL) classrooms in Germany. The present study explores one reason behind this absence of video games from EFL teaching practices: With the help of a thematic discourse analysis, it examines the negative reputation video games still obtain in current German EFL textbooks. More precisely, it will be shown that video games are often represented through the discursive lens of gaming disorder. Textbooks display digital games as a matter of addiction and mental illness and, as such, they serve as important gatekeepers in the EFL classroom that potentially keep teachers away from perceiving video games as valuable learning materials. © 2023 Narr Francke Verlag.

We collected and analyzed 1,145 data instances, sampled from a total of 31 middle-school students’ audio-and video-recorded gameplay sessions. We conducted data wrangling with student gameplay data from multiple data sources, such as individual facial expression recordings and gameplay logs. Using supervised machine learning, we built and tested candidate classifiers that yielded an estimated probability of distress states. We then conducted confidence-based data fusion that averaged the estimated probability scores from the unimodal classifiers with a single data source. The results of this study suggest that the classifier with multimodal data fusion improves the performance of tracking distress states during educational gameplay, compared to the performance of unimodal classifiers.

This expanding literature highlights the extraordinary power of video games as a potential medium to train brain functions, but also the remaining challenges that must be addressed in developing games that truly deliver in terms of learning objectives. Such challenges include the need to: (1) Maintain high motivation given that learning typically requires long-term training regimens, (2) Ensure that the content or skills to be learned are indeed mastered in the face of many possible distractions, and (3) Produce knowledge transfer beyond the proximal learning objectives. Game design elements that have been proposed to support these learning objectives are reviewed, along with the underlying psychological constructs that these elements rest upon.

Such increased access has led to increased scholarly interest in students’ online gaming habits in both countries. However, there is little research available about how undergraduate students in both countries consider their own and their peers’ gaming attitudes and habits, especially when these are sensitively aligned with “addiction.” Lacking too is research about how they think gaming impacts learning and academic performance between students from different university disciplines. This research examines undergraduate students in Thailand and China from the humanities compared with those from other disciplines in respect to their attitudes to and awareness of gaming addiction. A sample of 181 students from international and private universities were surveyed. Their interactions with leading games were analysed. A Likert scale was used alongside open-response questions and qualitative discourse analysis forming a mixed method to interpret these results. It is shown in this descriptive-inferential study that that students’ field of study, whether they actively played games and how often they played games all impacted how they valued their own gaming and defined the concept of “addiction.” Humanities and science students showed the same gaming habits as per daily hours spent gaming; business/economics students gamed less overall. Those who considered themselves addicted to gaming, perceived gaming addiction to account for 15-21hours spent gaming per week. Threshold gaming hours, positive and negative aspects of over gaming and a variance between moral and aesthetic appreciation of gaming as it impacts gamers’' lives were noted. © 2023 Universidad de Sevilla.

In this work, we present Aventura Marina, a serious video game inspired by escape room game mechanics, composed of an app and an authoring tool, which aims to promote visitors’ engagement with the new exhibition Sea Hall of the Caracol Museo de Ciencias, a Mexican museum in the northwest of Mexico. To design Aventura Marina, we followed a user-centered design approach, based on the design thinking methodology. We evaluated the high-fidelity prototype of the game and the low-fidelity prototype of the authoring tool with museum staff and potential visitors. Our results indicate that Aventura Marina has the potential to promote visitors’ engagement with the Sea Hall exhibition as participants indicated having a positive experience, recognized that they were more interested in and less bored by the topics of the exhibition and that they were eager to play the game again. In relation to the authoring tool, museum staff mentioned how this project could be implemented in other halls of the museum. Finally, we discuss the improvements for a future iteration of the prototypes and how this kind of technology can complement the content of museum exhibitions. © The Author(s) 2023.

While several domains have been the recipient of such focus, particular importance has been placed on the cultural heritage (CH) field, with examples demonstrating the promise of location-based games (LBGs) at enhancing the CH experience aimed at promoting awareness. Games like Pokémon GO have exacerbated the appeal of LBGs, showing that they can be as popular as blockbuster video games. However, as much potential as LBGs have in raising CH awareness, they can be challenging to build because, unlike their commercial counterparts, their primary aim is learning, emphasizing the cultural significance of the real-world location rather than augmented assets. With limited research that explicitly identifies elements in creating these games in CH contexts, this work aimed to identify design practices and considerations in the design of LBGs. This work is intended for educators, researchers, instructional designers, game developers, and those in the CH field interested in exploring creative ways to embody a deeper understanding of and appreciation for CH. © 2022 by the authors.","augmented reality; cultural heritage; design practices; location-based games; serious games; video games","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146772367"

Adolescents with poor parenting practices may have poor academic performance in school, have low self-evaluation, and are more likely to be captured by video games and short videos. The present research explored the mediating role of fashion values and self-esteem in the relationship between a negative parenting style and adolescent learning ability. We aimed to deepen our understanding of the relationship between family parenting and adolescent value identity, as well as between individual self-esteem and school adaptation. We based our research on a total of 997 students in Shanghai from grades 6, 8 and 10. Furthermore, we made use of parenting behaviour, Chinese adolescent values, and of the revised Chinese version of the class drama questionnaires and of the Children’s self-awareness scale. The chain mediation model was used to analyse the mediating effect of fashion values and self-esteem on parental rejection and peer evaluation learning ability. The results showed that fashion values played a partial mediating role between parental rejection and adolescent learning ability, and that parental rejection positively predicted fashion values, and fashion values negatively predicted learning ability. Self-esteem played a partial mediating role between parental rejection and adolescent learning ability, while parental rejection negatively predicted self-esteem and self-esteem positively predicted learning ability. Fashion values and self-esteem played a chain mediating role between parental rejection and adolescent learning ability, as parental rejection negatively predicted fashion values, fashion values positively predicted self-esteem, and self-esteem positively predicted learning ability. In conclusion, a negative parenting style influenced the development of adolescent value recognition and self-esteem, and affected the development of adolescent learning ability. That said, we should encourage families to adopt a positive parenting style and adolescent quality education to positively impact adolescent development. © 2023 by the authors.","Chinese adolescents; fashion values; learning ability; parental rejection; self-esteem","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85148855031"

It provides learners with learning resources that comply with their characteristics and preferences or offers them tasks and quizzes adapted to their performance. This research presents how we apply this concept to an educational video maze game created and generated on the APOGEE platform. In particular, this article explores the following three research questions: (1) Which characteristics in the student’s model should be considered for the personalization of educational video games? (2) What are the student’s preferences regarding the personalization of educational video games? (3) How should the process of personalization of educational video games be organized? The answers to these questions are found by conducting practical experiments concerning user experience with the educational maze video game. The article also describes the model of students comprising user’s, learner’s, and player’s aspects with both static and dynamic features. Further, the personalization process of educational games based on this model is described. The results showing the student’s preferences are presented and critically examined.

In this paper, I focus on key images and discussions circulating in the press and on social media around the performance and construction of the livestreaming space in relation to virtual learning and remote work among white collar professionals. Livestreaming reshapes domestic life and space through its ability to blur the boundary between home and work and the nascent norms and practices of livestreaming borrow from existing streaming subcultures such as video game streaming on platforms like Twitch.tv. The intimacy of livestreaming, however, is a double-edged sword as it exposes livestreaming’s inability to curtail the worst effects of the pandemic and the disproportionate impact of this vast social rearrangement on women. Livestreaming is easily integrated into existing regimes of control and is the subject of an intense public debate about its politics this very reason. © Author(s) 2022.","digital divide; education or instruction; gender; labor; livestreaming; media infrastructure; popular culture","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85126030352"

Drawing on interviews conducted in 2021 with 13 unaccompanied refugee youths (16–25 years old) and 10 social actors working in eight organizations, this study investigates the gaming habits of such youths in Norway and the ways in which relevant social actors are involved in guiding their gaming practices. This study shows that social actors’ views on gaming vary according to their level of involvement in the youths’ housing arrangements. Whilst those working directly with such arrangements are involved in direct or indirect rule‐setting for gaming practices, others struggle to find their role within this context. The youths, how-ever, emphasize the importance of gaming in building relationships with other unaccompanied refugees, learning about the culture of socialization, and mitigating trauma. Moreover, there is a lack of a dialogical approach to welfare services’ regulation of these youths’ gaming practices. Employing such an approach could not only give these youths a voice but also expand gaming’s democratization ability beyond the family context. © 2022 by the author(s);.","active meditation; digital care labor; gaming practices; refugee youths; social actors; video games","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145867480"

In fact, waste management issues took a new step with the recent discovery of microplastics in human blood for the first time, as it used to be a hypothesis. Instead of separating those questions, some researchers tend to consider that a link exists between the effects of global warming and plastic degradation in the ocean. Research focusing on the construal-level theory and the psychological distance explain the lack of public interest in the environmental crisis. However, recent studies highlight the empirical support of the psychological distance instead of the CLT, especially regarding climate change, but a few studies explore the psychological distance related to plastic pollution. With that in mind, any means to reduce the perceived psychological distance regarding environmental issues such as plastic pollution might increase their sensitivity and motivation to act. Moreover, the change of habit could be induced by a new event that would disrupt someone’s daily life according to the habit discontinuity hypothesis, and the use of immersive media such as video games might be the solution. Given numerous possibilities of creation with the scenarios, gameplay, public of interest and gaming contexts, video games also influence motivation, engagement and learning ability. We can also find specific components and mechanisms from game design in media that do not focus on entertainment first but on pedagogical purpose: serious games. Thus, this study investigates how immersive media might reduce specific psychological distance dimensions and trigger emotions using an educational video game on plastic pollution, which might play a major role in changing ones’ daily habits. The research uses a qualitative method centered on semi-structured individual interviews and the experimentation of a video game named Plasticity. Results support all the propositions and show that different types of immersion might reduce each dimension of the psychological distance, which is a first, reinforcing environmental awareness and new intentions of pro-environmental behavior. Other areas of discussion are furthered explored. © 2022 by the authors.

The Korean Ministry of Education, meanwhile, is resistant to adopting educational games as a part of its accepted pedagogy. This resistance has created a significant gap between the interest in video games as a learning tool and that of video games as an industry and career path in Korea.

During the development process for gaming resources, educators need feedback to ensure a quality learning experience. In many cases this feedback is generally received from students at the end of the subject or course and is often regulated centrally. Another way of garnering feedback and capturing player analytics could be to capitalize on the millions of global gamers. A game developed for use in a Health Sciences and Medicine program, The King's Request: Physiology and Anatomy Revision Game, was made freely available on the Steam platform. Over 16,000 Steam users engaged with the game over 12 months, with 150 providing written reviews. In contrast, a cohort of 100 first-year health science and medical students were requested to review the game after playing in class, with only 17 providing written feedback. In reviewing feedback, similarities were found between the groups, such as where both Steam community players and in-class students requested more questions and a longer game. However, the Steam community highlighted several unique aspects which could be used to improve the game for learning, such as a refined implementation of the incentive system. As the online gaming community is far larger than students enrolled in any tertiary subject, its expansive feedback can be used to accelerate the design and refinement of serious games. This wealth of feedback could provide unique insights for educators wishing to improve the provision of games in education and the overall student learning experience. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Educational games; Game analytics; Game reviews; Game science; Gamification; Video games","Human computer interaction; Interactive computer graphics; Learning systems; Serious games; Steam; Educational game; Game analytic; Game reviews; Game science; Game-based Learning; Gamification; Health science; On-line gaming; Tertiary institutions; Video-games; Students","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85133835071"

In the two examples, we reveal how the child leveraged digital tools to coordinate fluidly and complete shared endeavours with others in his gaming environments. Moreover, through in-depth analyses of the child’s video gaming activity, we argue that children learn by observing gamer-produced media and pitch in to online gaming communities through their gameplay.

Virtual reality and game-based rehabilitation applications are becoming increasingly popular in rehabilitation, including visual perception rehabilitation. However, the usage of commercially available and easily accessible games as intervention tools raises the question whether rehabilitation conducted with these games is really rehabilitation, or just casual gameplay. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the effects of a nonactively supervised (game-based intervention program [GIP]) and an actively supervised (therapist guided game-based intervention program [TGGIP]) on the visual perception skills of children with SLD. Materials and Methods: This study was designed as a single-blind randomized, controlled trial of a TGGIP on visual perception skills in children with SLD compared with the self-oriented, nonsupervised program (GIP). A total of 138 children with SLD participated in the study and were randomly divided into two groups (TGGIP and GIP). Children's visual perception skills were assessed with Motor-Free Visual Perception Test-3. Results: Both groups showed significant improvements in visual perception after the intervention programs (P < 0.05). However, the TGGIP (a supervised and structured intervention program) was significantly more effective in improving the visual perception skills compared with the GIP (a standard, nonsupervised, and unstructured intervention program) (P < 0.05). Conclusion: We think that the TGGIP methodology that we designed acts as a facilitator for therapists in using trademarked, commercially available, and easily accessible games for structured and supervised virtual reality and game-based rehabilitation applications.  © 2022, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.","Specific learning disability; Therapist guided; Virtual reality; Visual perception","Activities of Daily Living; Child; Humans; Learning Disabilities; Single-Blind Method; Video Games; Virtual Reality; child; controlled study; daily life activity; human; learning disorder; randomized controlled trial; single blind procedure; video game; virtual reality","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131346656"

Many studies have found that student learning is improved in flipped learning environments; however, this is still an open question. Much of the literature employs quantitative methods to reveal the effect of flipped learning on certain variables such as engagement, performance, and so on, but there have been few studies that investigate the Community of Inquiry variables perceived by learners in flipped learning environments. Objectives: This study investigated the levels of teaching, social, and cognitive presence of teacher candidates in an online flipped learning community, whether these variables were related to academic achievement, and teacher candidates' experiences with the online flipped learning approach. Methods: A case study research design was used in this study. Without any face-to-face meetings, the course was delivered using an online flipped learning approach. While quantitative data were collected from 34 teacher candidates, 16 teacher candidates participated in the qualitative part of the study. Focus group interviews, an open-ended questionnaire, a Community of Inquiry Scale, and teacher candidates' course grades were used to collect data. Both descriptive and content analysis were used to analyze the data. Results and Conclusions: In the current study, effective online flipped learning design fostered teaching presence, with perceived teaching presence having the highest mean and perceived social presence having the lowest. Course videos prepared by the instructor, as well as synchronous activities such as peer presentations, questions, and video discussion, all contributed to cognitive presence through the practice of theoretical knowledge. Although none of the variables in the community of inquiry were related to academic achievement, computer-based games like Kahoot contribute to a positive online flipped learning community. Many benefits of online flipped learning have been stated, including providing active, flexible, autonomous, and interactive instruction through the use of technology, creating a fun learning environment, and increasing perceived learning and interaction with the instructor. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","case study; community of inquiry; course design; online flipped learning; teacher training","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85115686315"

The first section is an academic review of the previous researches on e-learning design. Results show that recommended characteristics and functions for effective e-learning environments are similar to LPs’ environment and innovation. The second section examines LPs’ use in pedagogy by analyzing the LP viewers’ behavior in the Livestream chat. Results show that the behavior of LP viewers in the Livestream chat is similar to student behavior in e-learning, such as providing comments, asking questions, and peer-teaching. The third section comprises comparisons of the game events in LP with learning activities. Results show that the game events found in LP are relatable to the activities in learning, such as taking examinations, learning concepts, and doing exercise questions.

The medical education community is in equipoise on whether multitasking ability is a fixed trait. Furthermore, it is unclear whether multitasking ability affects those who gravitate toward careers that demand it, particularly among medical students deciding on a specialty. We sought to define the association between specialty choice, multitasking abilities and multi-patient care delivery among pre-clinical medical students. For this study, we examined both efficiency and accuracy metrics within multitasking and whether they were different between students choosing specialties. Methods: This was a planned cross-sectional sub-study focused on 2nd year medical students (MS-IIs) within a parent study evaluating multi-patient care skills using a serious game (VitalSigns:EDTM) depicting a pediatric emergency department. Subjects completed a Multitasking Ability Test (MTAT) and five VitalSigns:ED gameplays. The predictor variable was specialty choice, categorized into multitasking and non-multitasking groups. Outcome variables measuring efficiency and diagnostic accuracy were obtained from the MTAT and the game. The primary analysis was a Mann–Whitney U test, and secondary analyses employed Spearman Rank correlations. Results: Twelve students applied to multitasking specialties and 18 applied to others. Those in the multitasking specialties had faster MTAT completions than the other cohort (29.8 vs. 59.7 sec, 95%CI difference -0.9 to -39.8 sec). Differential diagnoses were higher in multitasking specialties in VitalSigns:ED (2.03 vs. 1.06, 95%CI difference +0.05 to +1.54) but efficiency metrics in the game did not differ. Conclusion: Multitasking and multi-patient care performance show some association with preferred specialty choices for MS-IIs prior to clinical exposure. © The Author(s) 2022.","digital game-based learning; educational games; medical subspecialty; medicine; multi-tasking; serious games; simulation/gaming; video games","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85130894611"

This renewed interest may seem paradoxical, insofar as John McCarthy introduced the term “AI” in the mid-1950s to mark a distinction with ML, championing deductive reasoning over automated induction (e.g., Cardon et al. 2018). By contrast, the current reversal, towards ML-based forms of “AI,” marks the statistical, if not spectacular, revival of automated induction. However, the terms used – revival, renewal, reversal – beg the question of the common ground of the involved alternatives. Taking its cue from recent historical (e.g., Penn 2020), relevant conceptual (e.g., Shanker 1998), and prior critical (e.g., Agre 1997) inquiries, this paper outlines a praxeological answer to the raised question. For the purpose, the paper develops a practice-based video analysis of a recent demonstration of “machine intelligence,” the video demonstration of an “agent system” playing Breakout at “superhuman level,” if not opening the gate for the advent of “general AI” (Hassabis 2017). In examining and engaging in “remaking intelligence” in situ, the paper dwells on the tricky interplay between machines, media, and montage, while making explicit and reflecting upon how particular configurations of “enchanted determinism” (Campolo and Crawford 2020) are staged and locally performed. © 2020 Tecnoscienza.

The aim is to investigate how participants employ callouts as part of their in-game interaction and teamplay, and what they orient to as ‘callout competence’. With a greater understanding of the social organisation of the multilingual game environment and actions, such as callouts, we can better understand the affordances for collaborative and multilingual learning that games can provide for education. Callout competence appears to align with skills and knowledge that may be transferrable into the educational setting; that is, the components that are part of callout competence require collaborative skills and multilingual competence. These skills are part of what makes the teamwork work, as well as an inherent part of activities in an esports education programme that has broadened the classroom to encompass esports game play outside of the classrooms. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","collaboration; conversation analysis; Esports; multilingualism; multiplayer","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85124295830"

The students in this discipline are often discouraged by the amount of information to remember and the complex and constraining syntaxes. Moreover, the computer environment they use daily has little relation to that proposed for learning programming and they do not immediately perceive the links between the two universes. In this article we have proposed a tool which aims to help learners in the one of the different programming language; it's a learning game called Java shooter to promote learning java programming with high motivation rate. This game will allow learners to understand the lessons learned with a kind of interesting motivation. The development of this game idea is carried out using the IMIE model for the creation of learning games, this model is characterized by its clarity, and simplicity of adaptation which give the hand to the teacher to integrate himself in the process of creation in most of the stages of learning, in order to ensure a better pedagogical playful adaptation, whose goal is to integrate this new technology into the education system. Overall, the teachers greatly appreciated the design of the ""Java Shooter"" which is based on the chosen model in several steps. Analysis of the empirical results shows that most learners have accepted this tool to strengthen the classical teaching materials of Java programming. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Computer science; Learning Games; Modeling; Motivation; Pedagogy; Teaching","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85123253926"

The aim of this paper was to pilot an assessment of physical literacy conceptualised in an ecological dynamics theoretical rationale. The assessment that was designed has a number of unique features: its scale of analysis is captured at an individual-environment interaction level during game play and it captures key affordances that a child is attuning to and how they are functionally playing the game. Data collection involved observing primary school children playing invasion games in physical education classes. Digital, video-based tagging (Dartfish Pro) of children's behaviours using the emergent game-based assessment tool was completed. Pilot data provided insights on the potential rich interpretations possible, such as readily differentiating between low and high physical literacy learners’ behaviours when playing small-sided games. Greater knowledge of the performance environment was observed in children with higher physical literacy, noted through a greater capacity to favourably regulate their relative positioning between competing and cooperating players, adopting more varied offensive functionality, and exhibiting greater attunement to key affordances.

We collected students’ gameplay behavior data using game log files and employed sequential analysis to compare their problem-solving and help-seeking behaviors upon receiving instructional videos at different timings. Results suggested that the instructional videos, delivered either before or after a game level, helped students identify the correct game solution at the beginning of medium-difficulty game levels. Moreover, receiving the instructional videos delayed students’ help-seeking behaviors—encouraging them to figure out game problems on their own before asking for help. However, receiving the instructional videos may possibly restrict students from creating diverse gaming solutions.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, as face-to-face activities declined and video conferencing expanded, a new platform, called the metaverse, appeared. The metaverse is a digital communication technology, that become known to the public through games and entertainment, and it is gradually expanding. The metaverse also provides new education methods. For high value-added industries, the metaverse is used to foster skilled experts in a shortened training period. In the education field, the metaverse platform is being used in convergence with information technology (IT) companies. Examples include the entrance ceremony, graduation ceremony, job fair, museum experiential learning, and graduation work exhibition of the virtual world through the metaverse. In this paper, college students’ experience of using the metaverse was studied to determine their awareness of and experience with the metaverse. Based on the potential of the metaverse platform, the MZ (Millennials and Generation Z) generation’s intention to use the metaverse, and their experience with it, it is expected that this study will aid the development of the metaverse. © 2022 University of Rijeka, Faculty of Medicine.

The project had two main objectives: to detect what teens are doing with media and to determine how they learn to do it. During the fieldwork, YouTube was identified as one of the platforms that teens use most for learning purposes. Therefore, this article maps teenagers’ main YouTube learning topics and motivations for using the platform. We studied the video formats that teens use and the way they use them to learn a wide variety of topics. Three main areas of interest were identified: formal school curriculum, video games and technology and wellness and culture. In all three areas, teens apply the apprenticeship model of learning as they follow YouTube instructors (teachers, experts and peers) to learn about these areas. Teens highlight different YouTube affordances that motivate them to use the platform, including using it as a search engine to find specific information, using the number of views or subscribers to validate the quality of the content, being able to control the video to learn at their own pace and using it as a repository and archive to find information. Teens use YouTube both to complement their formal school curriculum and to explore their own interests. Therefore, YouTube becomes an important learning space for adolescents to learn in a continuum. This means that it is a space that blurs the boundaries between classic oppositions like formal/informal learning due to how teens use it. © The Author(s) 2022.","Digital apprentice; gameplay; informal learning; teenagers; tutorial; vlogs; YouTube","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85127306619"

Four databases were researched: PubMed, Scielo, Science Direct, and SCOPUS, including publications between 2012 and March 2021. The initial results indicated 4881 records. After the selection process, 15 manuscripts that presented the central theme of the study were selected. The main results indicated that intervention strategies are rather heterogeneous. Most of the studies demonstrated efficient results after intervention protocols, many of them were conducted in Europe, and 46% occurred in a school environment. No research was identified involving technological solutions using executive functions, motor development, and digital games in an integrated manner.

The study was conducted as part of a pilot research project “SCOLLAm,” researching various approaches to learning with tablets in primary school in Croatia. To explore engagement in such an environment, an experimental approach based on an innovative digital lesson platform is taken, comparing augmented reality-based digital lessons and multimedia-based ones. In both approaches the contents are being shared, but presented differently, thus isolating augmented reality effects versus general technological intervention effects, an approach so far not explored in the early primary school context, but important, per existing literature. The data is analysed via video coding based on accepted engagement observational techniques and qualitative analysis. The results show that the AR-based interactive learning experiences are in general more cognitively and overall engaging in the early primary school context, while having less non-engagement or disengagement of the students than interactive learning experiences in multimedia digital lessons. Those findings are triangulated via teacher interviews and student focus groups, identifying likely reasons for such a difference, and examining how to best apply the results in everyday educational practice. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic The effects of Augmented Reality Learning Experiences (ARLEs) on students’ knowledge and achievement are a common field of research interest by educational AR researchers. Student engagement is often used as proxy for student achievement as it has shown correlations with it, both generally and in ARLEs, and is thus also commonly of interest. It is difficult to isolate the effects of AR versus the effects of the fact that a technological intervention occurred in general; often requested in recent literature, it has so far been only done in two studies, in early childhood learning and university-level education contexts. What this paper adds The paper presents an experimental study on engagement of students during ARLEs in early primary school (ages 7–8), one of the contexts most interesting to researchers, comparing lessons using the same contents in ARLEs and multimedia digital lessons, thus isolating AR effects from general technological intervention effects. The study shows ARLEs in this context providing more cognitive and overall student engagement, while having less non-engagement or disengagement. Student focus groups, composed of students exposed to both AR and non-AR lessons on tablets, explain this engagement by their perception of ARLEs as educational play. Implications for practice and/or policy With the building up of the corpus confirming engagement benefits, researchers and teachers can more confidently assume their presence when preparing ARLEs in primary school contexts, making for a stronger case for the use of ARLEs in this context. The findings, triangulated with teachers’ and students’ focus group feedback, support deploying ARLEs for review and reinforcement of learned contents. Not originally targeted, the findings give underlying empirical support for further research into AR Game-based Learning, a developing field. © 2022 British Educational Research Association.","augmented reality; experiment; observation; play; primary education; qualitative research; tablet","Educational technology; Engineering education; Learning systems; Students; Video signal processing; Learning experiences; Observation; Play; Primary education; Primary schools; Qualitative research; Reality learning; School context; Student engagement; Tablet; Augmented reality","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85124602285"

Specifically, popular media can be used to develop students’ historical literacies – that is their ability to engage with past societies vastly different from their own. Our methodology takes inspiration from the ancient Romans’ own partial literacies and utilises pedagogy drawn from Classical Reception Studies, which examines how the ancient world has been subsequently reinvented in everything from poetry to cinema. While traditional methods of teaching Classics potentially alienate learners and entrench the discipline’s elitism, we advocate learning about the past from a point of familiarity. Harnessing familiar texts and platforms to teach history can engage non-traditional learners and develop their historical literacies by leveraging pre-existing digital literacies. Furthermore, digital pedagogy fosters in students a sense that they can valuably contribute to disciplinary knowledge by recontextualising ancient sources. © The Author(s) 2021.","ancient history pedagogy; classical reception studies; digital literacy; digital pedagogy; enquiry based learning; historical literacy; Historical Studies; history in film; history in video games; popular culture pedagogy; student research","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85118831988"

However, experiencing spatial presence requires the allocation of limited processing resources, potentially inhibiting the processing of other information. Guided by the frameworks of Limited Capacity Model of Motivated Mediated Message Processing (LC4MP), and the cognitive theory of multimedia learning, two experiments examined the effects of different modalities on spatial presence to test the prediction that spatial presence negatively impacts recall. Study 1 (N = 100) found that VR elicited higher spatial presence than video, but that high spatial presence reduced recall. Individual differences (technology apprehension) moderated spatial presence. Study 2 (N = 260) found that pre-existing interest in the learning content and aversive responses elicited by the learning content increased spatial presence. However, segmenting the VR content to reduce processing load for participants had little effect on spatial presence or information recall. In sum, modality features and individual differences drove user experiences of spatial presence, which negatively impacted recall, but segmentation of VR content had no effect on learning outcomes. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Augmented and virtual reality; Games; Human-computer interface; Limited capacity; Recall; Simulations; Spatial presence","Computer games; E-learning; Augmented and virtual realities; Game; Human computer interfaces; Individual Differences; Learning contents; Limited capacity; Recall; Simulation; Spatial presence; Unintended consequences; Virtual reality","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129764706"

Factors such as parental education, interest, and child-directed speech influence how children perceive and engage with science. While the role of informal early learning settings in providing a space for parents and children to engage with science has been documented, the power of joint parent–child engagement in adult-oriented learning programs has been largely unexplored. This article explores a media-enhanced model designed to support family science within adult-oriented programs serving populations with low incomes. Families in these communities possess limited economic resources and social capital for engaging in traditional science settings. The model integrates promising features to improve science engagement for families with low incomes, such as staggered instruction, media modeling, and facilitated instruction. In this study, educators introduced science ideas to parents enrolled in adult education classes using “activity sets” that included animated videos, a digital game, and hands-on activities. Afterwards, parents used the activity sets to explore the same science ideas with their children, either in a facilitated family education setting, or at home on their own. Researchers collected qualitative data through event observations, parent interviews, parent focus groups, and educator interviews. They collected quantitative data through post-event parent surveys. Findings suggest that the model effectively promotes parents’ and children’s engagement with science and has the potential to increase adult comfort and confidence with family science. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Digital media; Early childhood; Family learning; Informal science; Joint engagement","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85107067279"

In particular, in this research, we set out to identify the potential of ‘Papers, Please’ to promote moral learning. Thus, we have tried to identify those objectives that go beyond the success in the video game and could favor moral learning. For this purpose, we have investigated what types of moral discourses arise from playing ‘Papers, Please’, a video game where you adopt the role of a customs inspector in a totalitarian state who must obtain the necessary money to fund their family. To do this, we analyzed the moral content of 1,560 player reviews. Results showed that only 4.94% of the reviews presented Moral Intuitions (moral content), which occurred more in the players who had played longer and had declared more Negative Emotions. As for the analysis of the Moral Intuitions, results showed that the players mainly made references to Care for both Family and Immigrants and point out the Authority of the State. However, Fairness/Cheating is less represented, despite the many events related to Immigrant discrimination. Through Exploratory Factor Analysis, we identified three dimensions, one of them pragmatic, oriented to success in the video game, and the others aimed at epistemic aspects beyond the objectives of the video game and that delve into the moral aspects of the game events. Hence, although spontaneous video game use is oriented toward pragmatic goals, ‘Papers, Please’ can guide players to think about the morality of the video game. Nevertheless, if we want to favor moral learning with ‘Papers, Please’, it is necessary to promote epistemic goals aimed at the explicitation of the morality that underlies the video game. To this end, we propose the application of scaffolding that favors these objectives. © 2022, The Author(s).","Epistemic goals; Learning; Moral Intuition; Pragmatic goals; Video game","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129758386"

The architecture of the “model for inclusive chemistry teaching” (MiC) is designed in a way that teachers can derive concrete, planning-guiding assistance from it. Following this model, we designed a learning environment “Fire & Flame” with real experiments, an interactive Multitouch Learning Book (a dynamic, web-based platform that allows the instructor to combine, for example, texts, videos, or learning games), and a paper-based workbook. The teaching unit was quantitatively evaluated with 165 students (aged 11-12) from different types of schools. Questionnaires and video recordings were used to assess the perceived fit of the teaching offer with the individual performance of students, supplemented by questionnaires for teachers. We showed that even students with a low interest in natural sciences answered all tasks in the knowledge test at a very high level. The use of the clickables in the Multitouch Learning Book did not differ significantly for the different types of schools. Significant differences emerge for the school types with regard to the other interactive offers: Secondary school students make greater use of the learning and language aids, grammar school students are more interested in the additional offers and information, and primary school students click more on the exercises with gaming character. © 2022 The Authors.

COVID-19 restrictions are resulting in decreased physical activity (PA) levels among children. Purpose: To determine barriers and challenges to PA promotion among children during COVID-19 and inform a PA promotion video. Methods: An explanatory sequential mixed methods approach was used to collect data from adults who have influence over the PA levels of children. Analysis included descriptive statistics of the quantitative data and a rapid qualitative analysis of qualitative data. Results: Quantitative and qualitative data indicated that space, eq\uipment, and virtual learning environments, among others, were key barriers to PA promotion, and that movement activities, game ideas, and brain breaks would be helpful video content. Discussion: Considering the content and features desired by participants, PA promotion video content can be used in various settings. Translation to Health Education Practice: We developed an animated video to promote PA in children and made it freely available on a variety of social media sites. The video may be used to enhance children’s PA levels in remote learning, school, and family environments. Participation in movement will contribute to children’s overall wellbeing and help prevent obesity. © 2022 SHAPE America.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85124186925"

Educational mobile games have their own niche, but at the same time many games made for self-entertainment can be re-purposed into teaching and learning, provided the game dynamics and mechanics are sufficiently present for active learning to take place. This paper is an early literature review and preliminary study on identifying students' perception of certain game dynamics and game mechanics so that in turn any decision in introducing mobile game apps into learning is able to measure their relevance and appropriateness to the target student user. The study employed factor analysis to construct a six-factor model that can be used in measuring students' preferences for, and aversions to, specific game dynamics and mechanics. © 2022 IGI Global.

Under such conditions, the use of the latest means of teaching the Ukrainian language has become one of the main priorities for the training of future foreign specialists in higher education institutions. The purpose of the work is to analyze and identify effective methods that will develop communicative abilities of foreign students in the process of learning Ukrainian. During the study, video materials, dictionaries and color schemes were used, and the survey was conducted with second and third year students. The results of the research showed that introducing students to the cultural heritage of Ukraine before the direct study of the language increased their motivation and desire to learn Ukrainian. In addition, due to the use of role/business games and video materials in stages in accordance with their specialization, there was an increase in vocabulary, as indicated by high rates of listening. In case of problems with the perception of information and its adequate understanding (reception), mnemonics were used, which included non-verbal sign language or the principle of situationality. The study also showed that most students have difficulties with learning grammar. Therefore, the method of color schemes was used, which helped to focus on the exceptions and rules with a certain color. The methodology proposed by the authors was used in the study of cases of noun and adjective. At the same time, students independently chose colors and made an association with the concept indicated by the teacher. In addition, during the work it was advisable to use dictionaries, in particular, to search for words of foreign origin, which greatly influenced the process of proper understanding of the educational material by foreigners. The results show positive changes for effective, high-quality and fast learning of Ukrainian language by foreigners. © 2022 by the Author(s).","cases; color scheme; foreign students; polystyle method; video materials","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145701806"

Therefore, nursing students need to learn how to assist with in-patient intubation, eliminate accumulated sputum overflow, and the basic techniques of sputum suction. Objectives: We proposed and investigated an approach to integrating online game-based learning with the watch-summarize-question strategy to improve nursing students' learning achievement, self-efficacy, learning engagement, and learning satisfaction in sputum suction skill training. Design: A quasi-experimental study with pretest and posttest design. Settings and participants: We randomly allocated 45 first-year nursing students to an experimental group (n = 21) or a control group (n = 24) at a school of nursing in a university. Methods: The experimental group adopted the online game-based learning and watch-summarize-question strategy, while the control group used video-based learning. Participants were assessed on learning achievement of sputum suction skills, self-efficacy, learning engagement, and learning satisfaction before and after the intervention. Results: The experimental group, which used the proposed approach, achieved statistically significant higher learning achievement, self-efficacy, learning engagement, and learning satisfaction than the control group.

In this context, educational technologies have a positive impact on the correct and effective teaching and learning of physical education and sports (PES), with a great positive impact on future sustainable higher education (HE). Thus, various innovative techniques could be of interest, such as the use of social networks and fitness sites, e-learning platforms, computer games, and telephone applications involving video analysis and age-specific images of students and the skills taught. This study aims to establish the main means used by technology, through which it can improve the teaching, learning, and practice of PES. This paper demonstrates the positive effects of technology on the PES field in modern society through a regression model, applied to data collected from 260 students from 2 Romanian PES Universities. The pedagogical and educational elements of our model also highlight the role of technology as a facilitator of knowledge, functioning as a tool that comes to the aid of specialists in the PES field. © 2022 by the authors.

Given the popularity of video games with teenagers, they can be incorporated as educational tools in the science classroom. However, the affordances of using Minecraft Education (Minecraft Edu)—as a game-based learning (GBL) tool—for learning atomic structure in junior high school have not been researched. The purpose of this article was to explore the affordances of Minecraft Edu for learning atomic structure in junior high school by exploring students’ experiences of using Minecraft Edu as a learning tool. The main research question was: what are the affordances of Minecraft Edu for learning atomic structure in junior high school? A qualitative research approach underpinned by an interpretivist paradigm was adopted for this research since the purpose of this research was to explore students’ experiences. The research was conducted with a class of 20 grade 8 students who were observed and interviewed at a South African well-resourced private school. An intervention aligned with the national curriculum for state schools was designed and implemented. It was underpinned by GBL as well as social, cognitive and radical constructivist perspectives. Methodological and source triangulation were used to ensure trustworthiness. Merriam's (Qualitative research: A guide to design and implementation, Jossey-Bass, 2009) constant comparative method was used to analyse data. Findings indicated that students were motivated, interested and challenged to think critically while collaborating and that the abstractness of atomic structure was alleviated. Although not all the features of the crafting stations of Minecraft Edu might promote active, deep learning of abstract concepts, it is evident that it holds some affordances for making atomic structure less abstract for students. It needs to be further investigated which features of the crafting stations of Minecraft Edu are conducive to deep learning, as well as the extent to which they are. Future research could also focus on designing an online Minecraft-based intervention as opposed to a face-to-face intervention as well as using Minecraft Edu in learning other curriculum topics across all grades and diverse learning contexts. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Atomic structure; Constructivism; Educational games; Game-based learning; Minecraft Edu","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85133269663"

Nevertheless, they are not always considered as educational resources in the teaching process. The purpose of this study was to analyze the attitudes of teachers at the preschool, elementary, and secondary levels in the Dominican Republic regarding the use of video games as an educational resource. To do so, a quantitative, non-experimental methodology was used with an exploratory-descriptive design, applying an exploratory factorial analysis with SPSS and a confirmatory factor analysis with AMOS. The results show that younger teachers, who have used video games, are more willing to incorporate them into the classroom than those who have never used them or been trained in their use. This creates barriers that limit the incorporation of these games into classes, which implies that there is an urgent need for teacher training in the grades studied in this field. © 2022 PEL.","attitude; games for learning; teaching resources; technology; training; video games","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146171195"

This study integrated theories of digital game-based learning (DGBL) and flipped classrooms, proposing the mini-game-based flipped classroom (MGFC) teaching model. In this teaching model, learners used a mini-educational game developed based on cognitive theories for DGBL autonomous learning in class, and then worked with collaborative problem solving (CPS) activities to improve learning and discussions. The study involved a quasi-experiment to evaluate this teaching model. The experimental group used MGFC, while the control group used the traditional flipped classroom teaching method by watching the video first and then having group discussions. The study analyzed the differences in the learning performance and acceptance of the two groups, and analyzed gender differences. Moreover, this study used quantitative content analysis (QCA) to explore learner’s concentration on their discussion content. The results showed that the MGFC group had significantly higher scores than the control group in their learning performance and acceptance. The MGFC group also showed a high level of flow. The QCA results showed that MGFC enhanced the frequency of learner’s learning discussions and their concentration in the learning process. © 2021, De La Salle University.","Collaborative discussion; Flipped classroom; Flow; Game-based learning; Motivation","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85104886959"

Our search strategy located 1599 articles from a dozen electronic research databases. Articles were analyzed for quality using the Hawker’s Evidence Appraisal Tool, and 23 qualitative studies were included in the final meta-synthesis. Technologies investigated largely involved online or blended learning, with fewer exploring virtual reality, simulations, telehealth, game-based learning, and videos. Three overarching themes were synthesized: (i) culture does matter in the implementation of technology-based learning; (ii) the values and limitations of technology used for learning; and (iii) technology is part of daily life and creates new challenges in education. Technology is an asset to enhance the learning experience, but educators must be aware of its limitations. Pre-coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) studies were more focused on technology and product, and were optimistically reported, whereas COVID-19–spanning studies focused on life experience and paid more attention to reporting on the inherent challenges.

Especially concerning the built cultural heritage protection in the coastal areas, both professionals and citizens have to be prepared for water-related extreme events, such as floods, sea-level rise, and altered precipitation. Considering these challenges, the authors explore the efficiency of serious video games and describe the process of design and validation of the pilot educational online maze game “Let us save Venice”. More specifically, the main research question motivating the study is to identify what the experience factors and the mini-games are that contribute mostly to raising awareness to climate resilience and built heritage sustainability. The question implies two main research objectives: first, to explore what role user-centered game design plays in creating immersive and enjoyable educational video maze games, and second, to investigate which factors influence user experience and game playability in the design phase, and how they contribute to learnability and raising awareness. The background section of the article focuses on a preliminary study of the educational potential of serious games and introduces the EU-funded project e-Creha. Then, it explores the process of game design, development, and validation, focusing on metrics such as game learnability and game experience. The results outline the main findings that immersion, positive affect, and competence appeared to be the main experience factors contributing to raising awareness to climate resilience and built heritage sustainability.

During the unit, the 9- and 10-year-old students recorded one another with an app and tagged certain game situations according to predefined criteria. The sequences (approximately 8 s) were discussed together during the reflection phases. Following the lesson, 65 guided interviews were conducted with students. The research approach focuses on the perspectives of the students involved. Data collection and analysis were based on grounded theory methodology. The interviews revealed very ambivalent perspectives on the use of the app. Overall, the students were very reflective about the use of the app. The digital medium was interpreted as an aid in the learning process and was clearly less important than playing the game itself. The children reported many attempts to implement the tactical ideas discussed together in the reflection phases in the subsequent game. However, many students who described themselves as good soccer players saw the app’s use as rather superfluous. The misuse of the film option was also interesting: The students often used this option as a video assistance referee, for example, to quickly clarify disputed situations. The results, thus, show extremely pragmatic handling of the digital tool by the students.

Videogames have been used to show how he has improved his learning. To do this, we have tested his capacities with a standarized reading test (DIP-le) and we have done a follow-up with a videogame called DytectiveU, which is supposed to overcome his dyslexia. We have verified, with he same test, that the more the child plays this game, the better reading capabilities and abilities he develops. Finally, we demonstrate and verify the benefits of using videogames in psycopedagogical diagnosis and psycopedagogical tracing.

The literature supports improvements in balance, cardiovascular endurance, and motor control; however, evidence is lacking regarding the implementation of AVG in PT education. This study investigated doctoral physical therapy (DPT) students' confidence following active exploration of AVG systems as a PT intervention in the United States. Methods: This pretest-posttest study included 60 DPT students in 2017 (cohort 1) and 55 students in 2018 (cohort 2) enrolled in a problem-based learning curriculum. AVG systems were embedded into patient cases and 2 interactive laboratory classes across 2 consecutive semesters (April-December 2017 and April-December 2018). Participants completed a 31-question survey before the intervention and 8 months later. Students' confidence was rated for general use, game selection, plan of care, set-up, documentation, setting, and demographics. Descriptive statistics and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test were used to compare differences in confidence pre- and post-intervention. Results: Both cohorts showed increased confidence at the post-test, with median (interquartile range) scores as follows: cohort 1: pre-test, 57.1 (44.3-63.5); post-test, 79.1 (73.1-85.4); and cohort 2: pre-test, 61.4 (48.0-70.7); post-test, 89.3 (80.0-93.2). Cohort 2 was significantly more confident at baseline than cohort 1 (P<0.05). In cohort 1, students' data were paired and confidence levels significantly increased in all domains: use, Z=-6.2 (P<0.01); selection, Z=-5.9 (P<0.01); plan of care, Z=-6.0 (P<0.01); set-up, Z=-5.5 (P<0.01); documentation, Z=-6.0 (P<0.01); setting, Z=-6.3 (P<0.01); and total score, Z=-6.4 (P<0.01). Conclusion: Structured, active experiences with AVG resulted in a significant increase in students' confidence. As technology advances in healthcare delivery, it is essential to expose students to these technologies in the classroom. © 2022 Korea Health Personnel Licensing Examination Institute.

In line with this trend, the emergence of the “Let’s Play” culture has significantly changed the manner in which people enjoyed video games. In order to academically explore this new experience, this study seeks to answer the following research questions: (1) Does engaging in video game streaming offer the same feeling as playing the game? (2) If so, what are the factors that affect the feeling of telepresence from viewers’ perspective? and (3) How does the feeling of telepresence affect viewers’ learning experience of the streamed game? We generated and empirically tested a comprehensive research model based on the telepresence and consumer learning theories. The research findings revealed that the authenticity and pleasantness of the streamer and the interaction of viewers positively affect telepresence, which in turn is positively associated with the gained knowledge and a positive attitude toward the streamed game. Based on the research findings, various practical implications are discussed for game developers as well as platform providers. © 2022, Asia Pacific Journal of Information Systems.

This age group tends to be more interested in playing computer and video games than doing their home- and class work with traditional materials such as textbooks and workbooks. Younger students need interesting activities that are fun for them and motivate them to learn and, as a result, make progress and achieve rapid success in their learning. It is therefore surprising that gamification has not yet been introduced into the curricula of Nigerian higher institutions. As a result, there is hardly any research in the field of gamification in foreign language learning in general or its use in the teaching of German in particular. This lacuna in research on gamification in German studies in Nigeria led to the present study, which examines the introduction of gamification into German lessons at Obafemi Awolowo University. The study aims at initiating a targeted discussion on gamification in German studies and stimulating further scholarly conversations on the topic. Through this, the possibility of creating a didactic design for the use of gamification in German studies in Nigeria can be achieved. This study uses secondary data sources including articles, books and reviews about gamification in education or classrooms. Other sources include websites and blog posts. These sources provide useful insights from various studies on gamification and its use in education, especially in foreign language teaching, which help in drawing up suggestions for a successful introduction of gamification into the curriculum of Nigerian universities especially that of German at the Obafemi Awolowo University in Nigeria.

To address these concerns, related literature suggests technology usages with a blend of digital and physical learning experiences. Towards this end, we developed Kid Space, incorporating immersive computing experiences designed to engage children more actively in physical movement and social collaboration during play-based learning. The technology features an animated peer learner, Oscar, who aims to understand and respond to children’s actions and utterances using extensive multimodal sensing and sensemaking technologies. To investigate student engagement during Kid Space learning experiences, an exploratory case study was designed using a formative research method with eight first-grade students. Multimodal data (audio and video) along with observational, interview, and questionnaire data were collected and analyzed. The results show that the students demonstrated high levels of engagement, less attention focused on the screen (projected wall), and more physical activity. In addition to these promising results, the study also enabled us to understand actionable insights to improve Kid Space for future deployments (e.g., the need for real-time personalization). We plan to incorporate the lessons learned from this preliminary study and deploy Kid Space with real-time personalization features for longer periods with more students. © 2021, Association for Educational Communications and Technology.","Collaborative learning; Game-based learning; Intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs); Mixed reality; Student engagement","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122504405"

Various reports warn that the lack of audience. If we focus on dance, and especially folk dances, the situation is worse. In various countries and continents, folk dances are slowly disappearing. In Spain, we find evidence of the downward trend in terms of the number of attendees to performances of Spanish dance -an art form that is highly valued throughout the world. In a generation marked by technological advancements, the only way for classic performing arts to reach young audiences - or digital natives – is to speak the same language they use with new technologies. This paper presents a study in collaboration with the Spanish National Dance Company, carried out with 877 students (aged from 9 to 12) from 12 different schools in the community of Madrid, Spain. We designed a two-phase experiment. In the first phase, we separated the students into 3 groups: students who played a videogame called “Dancing a Treasure,” those who received a workshop from professional dancers, and a control group. In the second phase that took place two weeks later, the participants attended to a real show of Spanish dance, and we studied how the previous educational approaches affected to the students increase of interest after the show. The experiment demonstrated that the videogame was, at least, as effective in increment interest about dance in younger generations as a workshop taught by expert dance professionals.

The au-thors of these papers rightfully stress that videogames and gaming take many forms, that what people actually do in and around games is as crucial to learning and liter-acies as the games themselves, and that gaming is intertwined with other literacy practices that vary considerably across the contexts of school, home, community, and online spaces. As with any overview as good as this one, one marvels at far we have come. Two decades ago, when Jim wrote What Video Games Have to Teach Us about Learning and Literacy (Gee, 2003), video gaming primarily was viewed as a deterrent to literacy and learning; at best, a form of mindless entertainment and at worst a medium that contributed to violence and aggression. The idea that the edu-cational benefits of gaming would become a legitimate area of scholarship in literacy education would have seemed absurd. Still, with all this activity, we can’t help but wonder (like Robert Frost) about the paths not taken in our collective interest in video gaming.

The analysis of students’ grades confirms improvement by applying gamified flipped classroom group-based assessments in the learning process. The students’ questionnaire also confirms that group-based assessments can improve students’ motivation.

This has involved the exploration of both Gamification and Digital Video Games Approach (DVGA). Both are viable pedagogical tools for any teacher, and each have clearly different intentions for impacting student learning. Unfortunately, and despite several distinctions, they have been misinterpreted. Purposes: The first purpose of the study is to offer a clarification of how these tools have emerged in PE and their underpinning mechanisms. This clarification explains their conceptual differences and similarities, with pedagogical implications. The second purpose is to highlight how understanding of this clarification can develop teachers’ Pedagogical Content Knowledge (PCK) and support more optimal usage and better impact positive student outcomes in PE. Key Arguments: PE teachers are responsible for delivering high-quality teaching and learning experiences which are informed by well-reasoned decisions of which blend of pedagogical tools to use, when and why. Unless a clarification is provided concerning Gamification and DVGA, these tools will continue to be used sub optimally. In short, we clarify that Gamification is underpinned by increasing motivation in the short term, through improving the attention and engagement of students. In contrast, the underpinning of DVGA is metacognition, and this tool seeks to deepen student understanding; a distinct (we suggest) longer-term agenda. Discussion: There is ongoing debate concerning the importance of a meaningful PE curriculum and how to engage students through games using a range of pedagogical tools. Gamification and DVGA are tools which share some commonalities (such as choice, challenge and feedback), but they also have distinct differences (such as planning, assessment and progressions, differentiation and the teacher’s role). Conclusions: By improving teachers’ PCK about the purpose and underpinning mechanisms of Gamification and DVGA, they will be better equipped to decipher which pedagogical tool to use, when and why. As a result, teaching is more likely to deliver optimal impact for students to increase potential for developing a love for playing games. © 2022 Association for Physical Education.","Engagement; metacognition; motivation; physical education; teaching","","Article","Article in press","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138727264"

This paper reports on a research conducted among 154 teacher candidates at a higher-education institution in Spain regarding the adoption of digital games in education. It analyzes the participants’ knowledge of and attitudes toward digital games in foreign language learning. Quantitative and qualitative data were gathered through a pre/post-test, digital game presentations, and student blog posts. The research comprised five stages associated with critical thinking skills (definition, selection, demonstration, discussion, and reflection), including a game learning module. In the first two stages, preservice teachers completed the module activities and selected different games aimed at teaching English to children in preschool and elementary education. In the last two, they illustrated, discussed, and evaluated the digital games in class following a rubric and reflected on their perception in blog posts. In this four-week research based on a mixed method and convenience sampling, quantitative and qualitative data were gathered through a pre-and post-test survey about student perceptions toward the use of video game in the classroom, class discussion, and blog posts. Statistical data analysis unveiled gender-based differences related to gameplay frequency and genre preferences. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used as a nonparametric statistical hypothesis test to compare the two sets of scores resulting from the same participants, and it showed a significant difference (p ≤ 0.05) after the treatment in two of the five dimensions in the survey about teacher candidates’ attitudes toward game usage in education, namely, usefulness (U) and preference for video games (PVG). Research findings revealed preservice teachers’ positive attitudes but lack of practical knowledge about the use of digital games in foreign-language learning. © 2022 by the authors.

Recent works have demonstrated the remarkable successes of deep reinforcement learning in various domains including finance, medicine, healthcare, video games, robotics, and computer vision. In this work, we provide a detailed review of recent and state-of-the-art research advances of deep reinforcement learning in computer vision. We start with comprehending the theories of deep learning, reinforcement learning, and deep reinforcement learning. We then propose a categorization of deep reinforcement learning methodologies and discuss their advantages and limitations. In particular, we divide deep reinforcement learning into seven main categories according to their applications in computer vision, i.e. (i) landmark localization (ii) object detection; (iii) object tracking; (iv) registration on both 2D image and 3D image volumetric data (v) image segmentation; (vi) videos analysis; and (vii) other applications. Each of these categories is further analyzed with reinforcement learning techniques, network design, and performance. Moreover, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the existing publicly available datasets and examine source code availability.

This study aimed to explore the medical students’ perception of using Kahoot in remote learning. Methods: The mixed-method study was carried out among 72 medical students (in third-year) at Eastern University, Sri Lanka, following a formative assessment on immunology conducted via zoom video conferencing and Kahoot. The students’ perception was collected through a google form, which consisted of 13 statements with a 5-point Likert scale and an open-ended question. Descriptive statistics and Mann-Whitney test were computed using SPSS ver. 25. A content analysis was employed to interpret the qualitative statements. Results: The participants’ age ranges from 23-28 years with male-female ratio of 1:1.57. The majority of the students felt happy (73.6%) while playing Kahoot remotely and recommended it (84.7%) for formative assessment in future. The participants agreed that Kahoot increased the focus, understanding of the subject, helped retain knowledge, motivated them to learn, provided fun during learning, and kept them active throughout. The majority of the participants agreed that Kahoot was an effective tool for distance learning. Internet connectivity and switching between two applications were identified as difficulties while playing remote mode Kahoot quizzes. Conclusion: The online gaming platform Kahoot has a positive impact on learning immunology. Kahoot maintains its fun and enjoyable nature and motivates students to learn during remote teaching of immunology. © 2022, Shriaz University of Medical Sciences.

Video games, which now feature extensive narrative structures, interactive play systems, and complex multimodal semiotics, offer one avenue through which ELA teachers can expand upon the texts and literacy practices included in language arts curricula. However, professional resources and research on the use of video games in literacy classrooms remain scarce. To understand how educators have begun to integrate games into ELA curriculum and instruction, the authors conducted a state-of-the-art review of the emerging literature on video games in secondary ELA classrooms. Through an inductive search and coding process, 21 studies were identified and analyzed. Two major findings emerged regarding both the specific instructional practices that instructors in the studies employed and the overall effects on students' learning described in the studies. First, the studies highlighted examples of video game instruction through the use of game analysis, game design and production, text production, and inquiry/research. Second, studies emphasized students’ expanded conceptions of literacies, development of literacy practices, growth of critical and analytical thinking skills, enhanced engagement, and increased opportunities for peer collaboration and mentoring. The authors discuss the implications of these findings for literacy instruction and research. © 2021 International Literacy Association.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119832431"

This study explores augmented reality (AR) and paper board games incorporating a brief antidrug educational program for students without drug-use problems to increase their antidrug knowledge, attitude, life skills, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, and intention to avoid using drugs. Materials and Methods: A total of 600 students were recruited, and 578 completed the intervention program and pre-and post-tests. The participants were randomly assigned to one of the following three groups: AR board game, paper board games, and comparison groups. The brief educational program consisted of two sessions. Generalized estimation equations were used to assess group differences in outcome variables. The paired t-tests were used to assess improvements in outcome variables of the two experimental groups. Results: The study found that the students who received the brief educational program featuring the AR board game was significantly different from the comparison group in outcome variables, including antidrug knowledge (P = 0.001), life skills (P = 0.004), subjective norms (P < 0.001), perceived behavioral control (P < 0.001), and intention (P = 0.02). The group with the paper board games also revealed similar findings as to the AR board game group in outcome variables, except for antidrug knowledge. There were no group differences in antidrug attitude between experimental and comparison groups. Conclusion: The results of this study support the efficacy of the two types of board games incorporated with a brief educational program. Results suggest that schools can adopt AR or paper board games as learning tools to assist in drug-use prevention programs and reduce the likelihood of students using illegal drugs. © 2022 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.","Adolescent; Augmented reality; Board game; Illegal drug; Prevention","Adolescent; Behavior Therapy; Humans; Schools; Students; Substance-Related Disorders; Video Games; adolescent; behavior therapy; controlled study; drug dependence; human; randomized controlled trial; school; student; video game","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85134854670"

The objective of this review paper is to highlight developments and perspectives in these areas in the GMS Journal for Medical Education (GMS JME). Methodology: In the spring of 2020, we conducted a systematic literature search of the Journal for Medical Education (JME) and analysed the articles with regard to different categories such as article type, digital tools used or mode of data collection. Results: Of the 132 articles analysed, 78 were digital interventions (53 of which were exploratory-descriptive), 28 were project descriptions, 16 were surveys of needs or equipment and 10 were concept papers. About one-third of the studies and project reports each dealt with virtual patients or case-based learning, whereas no articles were published on trends such as serious games or virtual reality. Overall, our analysis shows that in many respects, the studies on digital teaching were more broadly based, especially between 2006 and 2010, after which this trend tended to decline again. Conclusions: Our analysis shows that publications in the JME consider some key aspects of digital teaching in medical education and continuing education, such as educational videos or virtual patients. The variability of information and methods of presentation advocate the use of guidelines to optimise the quality of scientific papers. Furthermore, clues for future research topics and experimental study designs are identified. © 2022 Kleinsorgen et al.","digital assessment; digital learning; digital teaching; e-learning; GMS Journal for Medical Education; literature review","Education, Medical; Humans; Learning; human; learning; medical education","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141856628"

In this study, we investigated the effectiveness of digital game-based learning in children by comparing the learning of foreign speech sounds and words in a digital game or a non-game digital application. To evaluate gaming-induced plastic changes in the brain, we used the mismatch negativity (MMN) brain response that reflects the access to long-term memory representations. We recorded auditory brain responses from 37 school-aged Finnish-speaking children before and after playing a computer-based language-learning game. The MMN amplitude increased between the pre- and post-measurement for the game condition but not for the non-game condition, suggesting that the gaming intervention enhanced learning more than the non-game intervention. The results indicate that digital games can be beneficial for children's speech-sound learning and that gaming elements per se, not just practice time, support learning. © 2022 The Authors","Automatic speech recognition; Digital game-based learning; Foreign-language learning; Gaming","Brain; Child; Humans; Learning; Phonetics; Plastics; Video Games; plastic; amplitude modulation; Article; child; electroencephalogram; evoked brain stem auditory response; evoked response; exergaming; female; game-based learning; human; human experiment; language development; long term memory; male; mismatch negativity; nerve cell plasticity; school child; second language proficiency; sound analysis; speech discrimination; temporal cortex; video game; brain; learning; phonetics; physiology; video game","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85130145713"

The research focus was to identify significant differences in terms of the gamers’ user-generated Facebook metrics and commentary sentiments. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and k-nearest neighbor sentiment analysis were employed as core research methods. ANOVA of the classified post categories revealed that photos tended to show significantly more user-generated interactions than other post types, while, on the other hand, re-posted YouTube videos gained significantly fewer numbers in the retrieved metrics than other content types. K-nearest neighbor sentiment analysis pointed out underlying follower negativity in cases where user-generated activity was relatively low, thereby improving the understanding of the opinion of the masses previously hidden behind metrics such as the number of likes, comments, and shares. The paper at hand highlights the methodological design of the study as well as a detailed discussion of key findings and their implications, and future work. The results per se indicate the need to utilize natural language processing techniques to optimize brand communication on social media and highlight the importance of considering machine learning sentiment analysis techniques for a better understanding of consumer feedback. © 2019, The Author(s).","Online gaming; Self-marketing; Sentiment analysis; Social media metrics","Commerce; Marketing; Motion compensation; Nearest neighbor search; Sentiment analysis; Social networking (online); Analysis techniques; Facebook pages; K-nearest neighbors; Marketing techniques; NAtural language processing; On-line gaming; Research focus; Social media; Analysis of variance (ANOVA)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077183295"

Inspired by prior research showing the influence of problem-solving mindsets in physical settings, this study is an effort to understand the extent to which an open-ended task influences subsequent problem-solving behaviors in a virtual environment. Specifically, we investigate creativity and its relationship with task design in Minecraft by comparing a well-defined task group, instructed to follow step-by-step directions, with a group pursuing an open-ended task requiring a higher degree of agency. Creativity is assessed using two conventional approaches: the Alternative Uses Test (AUT) and the Consensual Assessment Technique (CAT). Judges were trained to evaluate using both methods and achieved sufficient agreement on a subset of the data prior to completing the full data set. Our results suggest that (1) participants who engaged in the open-ended task receive significantly higher CAT scores than those in the well-defined task group, and (2) among variables such as the level of skill/experience, interest in Minecraft, and materials (blocks) used in Minecraft, only game interest level has a significant influence on the CAT score. © 2022.

Linguistically, a portmanteau combines deep learning aspects of AI with the doctored or falsified enhancements that deem the content fake and now deepfake or misinformation results. A variety of sophisticated software programs’ exacting algorithms create high-quality videos and manipulated audio of people who may not exist, twisting others who do exist, creating the potential for leading to the spread of serious misinformation often with serious consequences. The rate of detection of this digital emergence is proliferating exponentially and the sourcing is challenging to verify, causing alarms. Examples of this pervasive information warfare are is associated with deepfakes that range from identity theft, discrediting public figures and celebrities, cyberbullying, blackmail, threats to national security, personal privacy, intensifying pornography and sexual exploitation, cybersecurity, baiting hate crimes, abusing social media platforms and manipulating metadata. Deepfakes that are difficult to cite, acquire, or track have some parallel attributes to grey literature by that definition. Often detectable, yet problematic, activities such as phishing and robocalling may be common attempts of deepfake activities that threaten and interrupt rhythms of daily life. The increasing online personas that many people create or assume contribute to this fake content and potential for escalated exploitation due to technical abilities to copy and reimagine details that are not true. AI image generators create completely false images of people that simply don’t exist within seconds and are nearly impossible to track. While AI is perceived as a positive benefit for science and policy, it can have negative roles in this new AI threatened environment. Deepfakes have cross-over targets in common business applications and society at large. Examples of this blur are targeted advertising, undetected security cameras in public spaces, blockchain, tabloid press/paparazzi, entertainment, computer games, online publishing, data and privacy, courtroom testimony, public opinion, scientific evidence, political campaigns, and rhetoric. This paper explores the impact and intersections of these behaviors and activities, products of AI, and emerging technologies with how digital grey and the optics of grey expose the dangers of deepfakes on everyday life. Applying a security and privacy lens, we offer insights of extending libel and slander into more serious criminal behavior as deepfakes become more pervasive, construing reality, endangering personal, social, and global safety nets adding to the new normal we assume today. How we became more sensitized to misinformation and fake news tells the story about deepfakes. © 2022, GreyNet. All rights reserved.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85184192876"

While many institutions shifted to remote provision with segmented lecture recordings, there is a lack of consensus about the length that these segments should be in order to best maintain engagement. Using a self-reported system of Likert-based diagnostics, 135 videos in use at Solent Uni-versity’s computer games area were analysed. Ninety-four students were asked to agree or disagree with statements in the format ‘I understand X’, each tailored to the subject material of the video in question. Repeated questions before and after the video allowed for a change in confidence to be measured, as an indicator of engagement. The resulting 4198 responses showed an optimum range of 5–8 min overall. However, the year of study emerged as a significant factor in this regard – with an optimum range for first years at 6–12 min, and for second and third years at under 8 min.

This is due to the fact that young people today are familiar with new technologies and virtual worlds outside schools as part of their leisure. A habit that enable these young people to be immediately in the heart of the matter since they already have a video game culture (gameplay) that allows them to focus on the main message. However, the integration of serious games in the learning process still limited since they don't provide efficient features for monitoring and assessing learner (player) interactions and decisions without breaking the nonlinearity of the game in order to show them the consequences of their decisions, a limit that has been proven in a previous comparative study [1]. In this paper we address the aspects of serious games (Robocode as example) integration and deployment into LMS (Dokeos as example) based on the automatic packaging and exportation of serious games as reusable learning objects (LO) that can be easily distributed through any LMS. This integration uses the ADL SCORM data model that defines how content may be packaged as a Package Interchange File (PIF), and the IEEE LOM Application Profile “SG-LOM” [2] as metadata description to describe every level of SCORM since the standard LOM doesn't meets the particular needs of serious games. © 2022.

Today, popular off-the-shelf historical digital games such as Assassin's Creed: Origins (2017), Total War: Three Kingdoms (2019), and Red Dead Redemption (2010) have achieved period-faithful and authentic interactive representations of elements of history that possess pedagogical value distinct from written accounts. To substantiate this claim, the authors forward a multimodal account of the varied ways in which historical knowledge is present in both game design and the gameplay experience. Their approach is illustrated with an under-investigated (yet valuable) mode of historical exploration - 'Imaginative History.' Using video and/or screen captures from several sequences of recorded game footage taken from A Plague Tale: Innocence, the authors present a case example from the game's fantastical portrayal of the Black Death plague. The game's value for teaching and learning is examined in relation to its re-mediation and subversion of past pre-modern folklore imaginations and beliefs concerning the Black Death. The authors also account for the relevance of the way games achieve a specific mode of engagement that is experientially based and structured within gameplay. © 2022 Ben Dorrington Redder and Gareth Schott, 2022.","Folklore; Historical fantasy; Historical video games; Multimodality; Plague disasters; Visuality design","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141533384"

Media and technology became a central tool to manage these activities simultaneously for different family members. This survey of 608 parents of 9 to 13-year-olds examines youth media use in this narrowly defined age group and also examines factors such as gender and parental worry about the pandemic. The vast majority of parents (83.7%) reported that their children were using media more during the COVID-19 pandemic than before. As with more use, parents reported varying purchases of media devices for the household, mobile devices for their children, and account creation in social media platforms for their children. Of the social media platforms available, parents most frequently allowed their tweens to create an account on TikTok (25%), followed by Facebook Messenger (23%) and Instagram (17%). On comparing girls and boys, it was found that significantly more girls than boys created TikTok accounts, whereas significantly more boys than girls created Instagram, Discord, and Twitter accounts. Established patterns of media use by gender before the pandemic were maintained. Boys continued to play video games, and girls watched videos. Because older tweens were more likely to already have social media accounts, we observed an influx of younger users on social media.

Culminating in the creation of a set of heuristics referred to as The 4 R's (repetition, recognition, relation, and reward), the article ultimately argues for a process of course gamification that relies on Jane McGonigal's (2010) conceptions of gameful design. More specifically, the piece illustrates that the material habituations that occur through gameplay can be translated to the physical classroom in ways that help students achieve their personal and professional learning goals through the practice of embodied gameful course design. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Course design; Embodiment; Gameful design; Materiality; Pedagogy","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85133850569"

This study aims to explore pathways from harmful to illegal online activity perpetrated by young people, legislation and police perspectives, current detection methods and interventions. Design/methodology/approach: This perspective paper examines issues observed within a larger systematic literature review on digital youth offending. Findings: A trajectory from acceptable to harmful and subsequently illegal behaviour was identified, with a particular pathway from unethical video game activity to digitally dependent offending. Legislation and police perspectives vary by jurisdiction, with a common theme that increased officer education is key to the level of preparedness to investigate cases. Machine learning and automatic prevention show promise as detection and disruption processes, with education recommended for young people as a deterrent and redirection of skills to positive outcomes. Research limitations/implications: Recommendations for further research include a broad survey of school students to include all identified areas of digital offending, which could drive the development of targeted education by law enforcement and partner agencies for young people. Practical implications: The shift in youth offending requires the justice and educational systems to adjust how they respond to youth crime. Policy and practise shifts can include further exploration of investigative hacking, education for law enforcement and educational prevention and redirection programmes aimed at youth. Originality/value: The digital displacement of youth offending is a progressively emerging concept. This paper examines the current state of response from educational and law enforcement agencies and discusses the next steps based on what is currently known. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Crime prevention; Cybercrime; Digital criminology; Police perspectives; Youth offending","article; crime; crime prevention; criminal behavior; criminology; cybercrime; education; human; human experiment; justice; law enforcement; machine learning; police; skill; systematic review; video game","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131409187"

Results showed unique relationships between three measures of learner motivation (i.e. motivation to learn, intrinsic motivation and engagement). Motivation to learn did not differ between conditions, while intrinsic motivation and engagement did. A significant portion of the variance in content reactions was explained by all three measures of motivation, while variance for technology reactions was explained only by the motivation to learn and engagement.

We look at how attachment anxiety, avoidance, and Behavioral Inhibition System (BIS) predict virtual conversational choices (i.e., to dismiss, deny, or reciprocate in virtual conversations during a virtual date). We tested this possibility through socially optimized learning in virtual environments (SOLVE-IT), a web-based, interactive 3D video game intervention designed for young men who have sex with men (YMSM) to reduce risky sexual behaviors. Data analyzed were drawn from 358 HIV-negative, self-identified MSM aged from 18 to 24, who were part of the SOLVE-IT intervention. Using ordinary least squares regression, we found that both BIS and attachment styles affect in-the-moment conversational responses and that attachment moderates the effects of BIS on those responses.

This study intended to fill the existing gap in research about vocabulary acquisition, using an experimental research design with a pre-test at the beginning of the program and a post-test at the end of the program. These tests were administered to 93 seventh grade EFL students. The participants were divided into three groups and taught using educational videos, online educational games, and conventional teaching respectively. Statistical analysis showed that there was a significant difference among these three groups. The use of educational online games resulted in higher achievement than the educational videos and conventional teaching.

Structural, cognitive, and content affordances of gamified learning are reviewed next, and the relevant knowledge, skills, and dispositions related to the purposeful design and development of digital gaming and game-like activities for classroom or personal use are noted as needed, including the learning behaviors deemed critical in second language acquisition. Thereafter, I discuss how such behaviors are discerned and actualized in the entertainment/education software collectively named system simulations, the pedagogical benefits attained through their judicious use, and the key features of some notable reacting games, (real-time and turn-based) strategy games, simulation “sandbox-style” games, and, finally, single-player simulation computer/video games.

Semiosis is designed by teachers as learning games, involving students in the simulation of cultural practices in which didactic writing sequences are realized in chains that shift meanings between different semiotic modes, giving rise to transmodal moments. This study combines three theoretical approaches: socio-semiotic, anthropological-didactic, and didactic-disciplinary. Our objective is to explore semiosis in the transmodal moments that occur in the virtual interaction during a didactic sequence. From the qualitative point of view, this case study examines the simulation of cultural practices of a female student in the fourth year of Chilean elementary education, using the integrated analysis of semiotic chains and Hybrid Text-Image-Sound Systems (HTISS). The findings offer a description of the learning games associated with two cultural practices, whose cores of meaning shift between six links. The semiotic tracking reflects the tension between the agency of both meaning-makers: the didactic meanings proposed by the teacher and the thematic meanings proposed by the student realized in the semiotic ensembles of teaching and learning mediated by a digital platform, in which the recycling of videos and documents is utilized.

One simulation features the Whaleback anticline, a site in central Pennsylvania (USA), with a three-dimensional exposure of a 30m high fold, based on a terrain model that was acquired through structure-from-motion photogrammetry. The second example is a fictional location with simplified geology, which was built with digital modeling software and inspired by the geology of northwestern Washington. Users move through the terrain, as if in the field, selecting where to make observations of the geologic structure. Additionally, these virtual field experiences provide novel visualization opportunities through tools like a geodetic compass that instantly plots data to a stereonet and a jetpack simulation, which allows the user to interrogate geologic surfaces in hard-to-reach locations. We designed the virtual field experiences in a widely used video-game-creation software and published the field simulations for access via the internet and common web browsers so that no special hardware or software is required to play. We implemented these field simulations to partially replace field and lab exercises in two different courses offered remotely through the University of Washington Department of Earth and Space Sciences, with assignments that address many of the learning goals of traditional in-person exercises. Because the virtual field experiences are open-ended, other instructors can design different exercises to meet different learning goals. While this game environment currently serves as an enhancement to remote education, this format can also augment traditional educational experiences, overcoming several challenges to accessing the field or particular outcrops and, thereby, broadening opportunities for participation and scientific collaboration.  © Author(s) 2022.","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138193870"

After detecting that video games may decrease physical activity and social interactions, real world is coming back to computer entertainment, with a new gaming genre: Pervasive games. These games integrate physical and social aspects of real world, so that they overcome the limitations of traditional games in the spatial, temporal, or social dimensions. Interactive spaces are a natural place to deploy pervasive games, as they both share their ubiquitous computing nature. Thus, we have tried to explore the possibility of having pervasive games in interactive spaces playing a role as learning tools, specifically for developing attention, planning, and social skills. This way, we have designed a pervasive game to be played in an interactive space to work on those aspects. The game is made up of ten different missions. Also, in this article, we have developed an observation and analysis model that allows identifying which processes get activated during the game, and we have carried out an evaluation with the model with the intention of validating the usefulness of the activities and of the model. Lastly, we have obtained some recommendations for the design and mediation of pervasive games in interactive spaces.  © 2008-2011 IEEE.","Hybrid games; interactive spaces (IS); pervasive games; planning-attention-simultaneous-successive (PASS) model","Computer games; Social aspects; Ubiquitous computing; Computational modelling; Educational tools; Game; Hybrid game; Interactive spaces; PASS model; Pervasive game; Real-world; Social skills; Video-games; Human computer interaction","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125726514"

Apps, games, computer programs, and social media, etc. can support and improve learning processes. The COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting restrictions of social life accelerated a shift towards the application of digital media in education as well as in distance learning. This paper answers questions about the current usage of digital media in non-formal education in Germany, especially in the context of Education for Sustainable Development (ESD). The results of a 2020 survey in Germany with 111 participants show that digital media are an integral part of non-formal education; in particular, audio and video recording and filesharing are used often. Notably, the usage of web calls and webinars has increased since the pandemic. Regarding the disadvantages of digitals formats, participants note the investment in time and effort as well as the expensive equipment needed for development. Despite being dissatisfied with existing offers, a lot of institutions have not developed their own digital education formats (yet). This indicates a possible need for further training and education of educators in non-formal ESD, enabling them to independently create digital formats. This would also contribute to the quality of digital formats, of which many were possibly developed without proper expertise. © 2022 by the authors.

Nevertheless, despite their potential to improve cognitive functioning, they are still studied rarely as a tool for digital game-based learning. To better understand video gaming practices’ value in the classroom, this article provides a systematic review of literature on the effect of entertainment video games on academic learning. Our literature search yielded 49 relevant intervention studies published between 2005 and 2019 that integrated entertainment video games into academic curricula from preschool to college. Our review revealed that entertainment video games can be an effective educational tool and are beneficial in almost all academic disciplines, particularly in foreign language and science. However, research on entertainment video gaming’s effects on academic learning is still not extensive enough and remains mostly qualitative. Future studies need to provide a quantitative approach to complete and confirm already-existing literature, particularly in the environmental and social sciences, physical education, and programming. Given entertainment video games’ popularity and benefits on cognition and learning, it seems essential to investigate their practical value further in the education sector and to determine the mechanisms that mediate their effects on academic learning. © The Author(s) 2022.","academic learning; digital game-based learning; education sector; entertainment video games; systematic analysis","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122785682"

This paper proposes an example for educators to integrate game-making activities into a chemical engineering curriculum. The specific activity proposed is a collaborative event, known as a game jam in Game Studies. Participants use a custom-made Game Editor for Learning to design levels for a jump n′ run/platform game. The editor facilitates the construction of games for non-game designers, has a tutorial, and is provided with inspirational gameplay videos of level examples and a template for facilitators to assess the resulting levels. This paper argues that prompting learners to create levels based on chemical concepts and structures, challenges and develops their problem-solving skills, and makes the activity valuable to be integrated in present engineering educational programs. The learning experience, named CHEM Jam, starts with an introductory phase during which participants receive essential guidance, while preserving the effectiveness, of learner-centred activities. The assessment methodology is aligned with the learning objectives of an undergraduate process design course. Finally, research and critique on the activity and how chemical engineering can benefit from game-making events and communities is discussed. © 2022 The Authors","Collaborative learning; Empowered learners; Game jams; Hackathons; Learner-centred approach; Problem-solving skills","Engineering education; Game design; Learning systems; Chemical engineering education; Collaborative learning; Empowered learner; Energy issues; Game jam; Hackathons; Learner-centered approach; Learning approach; Problem solving skills; Sustainability issues; Curricula","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85134051744"

Because the opponent hits the ball before the impact, the server has very limited feedback about the short serve accuracy. The short serve should be aimed as close as possible to the short service line. The practice can differ from the match conditions, as the serve is usually performed with various accuracy. Aim of Study: The aim is to find out if limiting the visual feedback affects the serve outcome in a badminton practice. Material and Methods: Ten competitive badminton players (29.4±5.7 years) with badminton experience of 10.4±3.9 years took part in the study. Altogether, each participant served 80 backhand short serves (20 with occlusion, 20 without occlusion, 20 without occlusion, followed by 20 with occlusion) on the court. Occlusion glasses blocked the server's vision in the moment of racket-shuttlecock impact. The shuttlecock impact on the court was recorded with the video camera and analyzed in Kinovea software. Results: The results showed a significant difference between the accuracy of serves without the occlusion (27.6±9.9 cm) compared to the visual occlusion (32.2±12.5 cm); t(9)=2.43, p<0.05, d=0.43. Conclusion: Visual feedback has a significant effect on the backhand short serve accuracy. Visual constrain of the serve outcome reduced the accuracy of the serves. In a practice match, the receiver could sometimes randomly let the shuttlecock impact the ground to provide feedback to the server. © 2022.

However, to provide real-life context in the learning of a foreign language is challenging. To help create such a learning environment, our previous research developed an innovative system called the R&T System, utilizing robots (R) and tangible objects (T) with Internet of Things (IoT sensors). As the R&T system is still new, there is no sufficient knowledge about what learning obstacles learners would encounter in such a context-rich environment and how best to support them. To explore these issues, in the current study, we designed an English vocabulary game to engage learners to interact with the R&T System. Adopting an action research methodology, we first conducted a pilot study with 12, fourth grade students to identify learning obstacles in a game setting. They were randomly assigned to two groups, one with learning support and the other without learning support. The experiment lasted for four weeks. Both pre-test and post-test on English vocabulary were used to measure the effectiveness of these learning support mechanisms. From the video recordings of the participants’ engagement with the R&T System, the results reveal that the learning support mechanisms had positive impact on the participants’ learning performance and significantly reduced the occurrences of learning obstacles.

Most of these digital environments are offered under “freemium” pricing to facilitate adoption and network effects. In these settings, users' early social interaction and experience often have a substantial impact on their longer term behavior. On this background, we study the impact of an algorithmic system that matches new users to existing communities in an assortative manner. We devise a machine learning-based matching system that identifies users with high expected value and provides them the option to join highly active, in terms of engagement and expenditure, teams. We deploy this mechanism experimentally in a digital social game and find that it significantly increases user engagement, spending, and socialization. This finding holds for more active communities and overall. Teams matched with low-activity new users are negatively impacted, leading to an overall more segregated social environment. We argue that social experience and social behavior in groups are likely mechanisms that drive the impact of the matching system.

The Hydrologic Cycle Game is a pedagogical tool for teaching students about the global water cycle through game-based learning. It familiarizes students with terminology related to transport, fluxes, and storage, using box models to understand complex cycles and visualize invisible processes, and introduces students to the concept of residence time. It was developed for university undergraduates but could be used in other educational settings. When deploying this activity in-class, it is helpful to introduce students to the vocabulary and the concept of box models prior to game play; a short lecture or prerecorded video was sufficient. One game typically takes 5–10 min to play, and, in the author’s experience, engagement increases when students have the opportunity to play multiple times. Student comprehension of terminology, connections, and directions of flow was assessed using pre and posttests. Scores increased significantly (p < 0.05) after gameplay with a large effect size (d > 0.8), and learning gains persisted through mid-semester evaluations. The data collected indicate that the Hydrologic Cycle Game is an effective tool for teaching the global water cycle.

Using quasi-experimental design, we evaluated the effectiveness of one educational program where participating preschool children learned about forest organisms through direct experiences in the forest (direct experiences) and the other program where children learned only in the classroom watching videos, books, played various table games, etc. (vicarious experiences). A total of 129 Slovene children aged 3-6 years were interviewed a week before, immediately after and six weeks after the end of the programs. Four tasks measuring their skills of observation were used in the interviews. The results indicate that both educational programs improved their scientific skills. Direct experiences lead to higher increase and persistence of acquired skills. Direct experiences are seen as crucial for development of specific scientific skills of observing and classifying forest organisms, but to certain extent some skills can be alternatively acquired through vicarious experiences. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Direct experience; educational programme; forest organisms; skills of observation; vicarious experience","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089998063"

Among different types of computer games, adventure games have received much attention because of their rich input and immersive learning environment. However, some researchers have indicated that because of the characters’ fast-talking speed and many new vocabulary, more lexical supports should be provided in the games. This study thus developed an adventure game with two versions. One version was an adventure game and the other was the same game supported with vocabulary exercises. Two classes were randomly assigned to play two versions of the game and to take a pre-test, post-test, and delayed post-test. A survey was also conducted to investigate the participants’ perceptions. The results showed that both groups acquired new words, but the experimental group performed significantly better in both the immediate and delayed post-tests. These findings indicated that the adventure game alone can help participants acquire new words. However, the inclusion of word-focused exercises further helped learners retain more new words. Thus, it is suggested that game developers can incorporate word-focused exercises into video games. The additional exercise can allow learners to benefit from both implicit and explicit vocabulary learning. © The Author(s) 2020.","adventure games; digital game-based learning; learners’ perceptions; vocabulary exercises","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092510317"

His “playing man” engages in game-like practices and rituals, in politics, and in war and violence, showing that play and culture exist side by side as a “twin-union,” but play came first (Huizinga 1938). © 2021, University of Chicago Press.

Because VR allows for realistic interaction with computer-generated 3-dimensional (3D) hologram-like learning objects with handheld controllers, it is inherently versatile, and we have therefore asked: Can we extend the documented benefits of such immersive experiences to an undergraduate chemistry lab at scale? This activity describes an in-class (i.e., portable) virtual reality chemistry lab, applied in an undergraduate biochemistry class, with over 200 students enrolled in 8 lab sessions, which took place at Harvard University in the spring of 2020. What made this deployment unique is that each student had the opportunity to individually explore the shapes of proteins and drug compounds and to learn how these structures explain function using the latest, tetherless VR technology (Oculus Quest). Students completed in-class, VR-based work with the aid of peer-to-peer support (pairs), and students engaged with this active learning module to observe, manipulate, and build molecules in an immersive virtual environment. The goal of the curricular integration is to improve students' spatial recognition of protein structures and engagement in 3D chemistry experiments. This particular VR lab has the advantages of being green (less hazardous, eco-friendly, low-cost) and portable (wireless, no computer needed, convenient to transport), both features that are easily applied to future chemistry classes, including remote courses that will undoubtedly become more common in the era of e-learning. Finally, we conducted survey research accessing students' perception of this portable VR chemistry lab and their self-reported learning outcomes.

Some researchers have been exploring the influence of gamification on female students as one of these possible learning engagement strategies. Gamification refers to the introduction of video game elements into non-game activities to enhance engagement and motivation. Previous studies have reported mixed results of the impact of gamification on women. In this study, we introduce SEP-CyLE (Software Engineering and Programming Cyberlearning Environment), an online gamified tool that was designed to provide supplemental computing content to students. This paper presents a convergent mixed-methods study guided by social identity theory and self-efficacy to understand women's experiences with this gamified tool. More specifically, this study explores virtual points' and leaderboards' effects on CS identity development, self-efficacy, and performance. The results show that virtual points and the leaderboard contributed to improved performance for students of all genders, suggesting that gamification is a gender-neutral learning engagement strategy that improves female students' performance as much as male students. Regardless of improved performance, most women did not actively enjoy or were motivated by the virtual points or leaderboard in SEP-CyLE.

The incentive system's purpose was to motivate students to access learning supports designed to facilitate content knowledge acquisition (i.e., content-related supports) and minimize the use of solution videos (i.e., game-related supports). Students (n = 199) could earn game money by accessing content-related supports but had to pay to watch solution videos. Results indicated that the incentive system effectively increased how often students viewed content-related supports and decreased their reliance on solution videos. Furthermore, students who viewed more content-related supports showed higher posttest scores and solved more game levels compared to those who watched fewer supports, controlling for pretest scores. Solution videos, however, appeared to have no effect on either posttest scores or number of levels solved. Finally, our analysis of students' behavioral data, extracted from log files, confirmed that students did not abuse solution videos.

Despite the extensive use of commercial English as a Foreign Language (EFL) vocabulary learning apps in China, there is a lack of a review of these apps for a systematic understanding of the components and usefulness of app-assisted vocabulary learning. To fill this knowledge gap, this study presents a systematic review of 15 EFL vocabulary learning apps that were most downloaded in China, focusing on how these apps help students develop word knowledge. The results of this study showed that most apps enabled students to access word knowledge through translating words into their native language. Notably, word knowledge was usually presented through text-plus-image and text-plus-image-plus-audio. Most of these mobile apps provided sentence examples as vocabulary learning materials. Many of these apps were integrated with game elements, especially in interactivity or feedback systems and reward systems. Based on the review results, we have provided three recommendations to vocabulary learning app developers concerning the use of video for the input of word knowledge, the efficiency of vocabulary learning, and the integration of more game elements. © 2021 Hong Kong Bao Long Accounting And Secretarial Limited.

In this case study, we examined the optimal design and the evaluation of learning support videos for a physics educational game. Often studies focus on investigating the effects of research-based principles without a systematic examination of the design and development processes. Thus, comprehensive design descriptions and recommendations for developing effective in-game learning supports are scarce in the literature. This study comprises two stages: design and evaluation. In the design stage, we collaborated with two physics experts to design and iteratively revise 18 learning support videos. We applied the First Principles of Instruction (Merrill, 2002) to create instructional strategies and multimedia learning principles (Mayer, 2017) to develop the videos and help learners engage in cognitive processing. In the evaluation stage, we presented the videos to 14 students to gather feedback on their perceptions and, in the following year, examined the effectiveness of the final videos with 263 students. Results revealed that, among all supports, the videos were the only support that significantly predicted posttest scores and game levels completed and viewing patterns did not affect game enjoyment. We conclude with a discussion of our experiences and recommendations to contribute to the foundation of designing in-game learning supports. © 2021, Association for Educational Communications and Technology.","First Principles of Instruction; Game-based learning; Learning support; Modality; Multimedia learning","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85105017444"

Many studies of memory and sensorimotor adaptation have proposed theories that incorporate a decay on prior events, which leads the agent to eventually forget old experiences. This study investigates if a similar decay mechanism can account for human adaptation in complex skills that require the simultaneous integration of cognitive, motor, and perceptual processes. In 2 experiments, subjects learned to play a novel racing video game while adapting to parametric changes in the physics of the game’s controls. Human learning and performance were modeled using the ACT–R cognitive architecture, which has been used successfully to model learning and fluency across a wide range of skills in prior research. Anderson et al. (2019) introduced the Controller module, a new component of the architecture that learns the setting of control parameters for actions and allows the agent to execute the rapid and precise actions that are necessary for good performance on complex tasks. Model simulations support including a moderate time–based decay on the weight of the experiences that the Controller uses. This is implemented in the Controller module by discounting the influence of older observations which helps the agent to focus on recent experiences that better reflect the current relationship between different settings of a control parameter and the rate of payoff from using that setting. © 2021 American Psychological Association","Act-r; Adaptation; Decay; Modeling; Skill acquisition","Adaptation, Physiological; Humans; Learning; Motor Skills; adaptation; human; learning; motor performance","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119617979"

Background: Although teacher-oriented authoring tools for creating educational video games can help overcome the main barriers hampering the use and uptake of GBL, there is a lack of studies examining the effectiveness of educational video games authored by teachers using these authoring tools by means of rigorous scientific methods. Research Questions: Is GBL using teacher-authored games more effective than traditional teaching in terms of motivation for computer science students? Is GBL using teacher-authored games more effective than traditional teaching in terms of knowledge acquisition for computer science students? Methodology: Two randomized control trials with pretest, post-test, and one questionnaire were conducted to compare the effectiveness of traditional teaching and GBL in two computer science courses. The sample of the two experiments was composed by 75 and 49 students, respectively. Half of the students attended a traditional lecture, while the other half learned solely by playing teacher-authored educational video games. Findings: The results show that GBL using teacher-authored games was practically as effective as traditional teaching in terms of knowledge acquisition, but that it was emphatically successful in increasing student motivation. Students who learned by playing educational video games found the experience more motivating and fun than their counterparts, and a vast majority of them preferred the GBL approach over traditional teaching.  © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Active learning; computer science; computer-based instruction; educational technology; games","Education computing; Human computer interaction; Knowledge acquisition; Motivation; Students; Computer Science course; Computer Science Education; Computer science students; Educational video games; Game-based Learning; Randomized control trials; Research questions; Student motivation; Computer games","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85102718116"

Data was collected about this intervention via three instruments: a pretest and posttest, a flow experience questionnaire, and interviews with participants. This pretest-posttest results analysis showed that both the experimental group and the control group showed significant improvement in their listening comprehension skills. Even though there was no significant difference between the improvements of the two groups, there was a greater increase in listening comprehension skills with the experimental group than with the control group. Also, the questionnaire results revealed that this video gameplay contributed to participants developing flow experiences. This flow experience showed numerous interesting insights about the participants and the learning environment.

In this context, research on teacher education assumes reflection on teaching examples–including real-life classroom practices–to have positive effects on teachers’ professional development. The role of media used in such examples is unclear, however. While text-based teaching examples might be more favorable for novice learners due to a step-by-step presentation of information, video-based examples that capture the complexity and reality of teaching situations might better foster the learning of advanced pre-service teachers. Method: In a field experiment, we taught principles of TGfU to 136 undergraduate physical education (PE) pre-service teachers and randomly assigned them to three conditions: they either reflected by themselves on a video-based or on a text-based teaching example or completed an open-ended planning-task. For the video-based example, a PE teacher and his class staged different scenes of a teaching unit following a script that focused on ‘badminton-like’ games considering steps and pedagogical principles of TGfU. The video-based example was transcribed and converted into a text-based example. Before the intervention, we assessed the pre-service teachers’ knowledge of game-centered approaches. After the intervention, we measured their knowledge of TGfU and affective-motivational variables (interest, challenge, enjoyment, annoyance). Results: The participants had a (rather low) comparable knowledge before the intervention. After the intervention, we found that reflecting on the video-based example had increased the knowledge of TGfU more than reflecting on the text-based example or completing an open-ended planning-task (medium effect). We found no interaction effect of prior knowledge and condition on the knowledge of TGfU at posttest. Participants with a video-based example reported higher interest and enjoyment after the intervention (medium effect). All other affective-motivational variables did not show significant differences. Discussion: Other studies concentrating on teaching in classrooms found that text-based examples fostered pre-service teachers’ competencies better than video-based examples if they had rather low prior knowledge. One explanation for the present finding could refer to the specific field of study: For novice PE pre-service teachers the supposed benefit of text-based teaching examples does not advance the learning process more than the supposed benefit of video-based examples (realistic display of constitutional aspects of PE). Since interest is closely related to (intrinsic) motivation, and the learners’ motivation is fostered by realistic and authentic context, our finding regarding the condition effect on interest and enjoyment is consistent with assumptions of situated learning theory. Higher motivation, in turn, could lead to a more elaborate analysis of the video-based example, which may ultimately explain the higher level of knowledge, too. Conclusion: The current findings indicate that video-based examples are a very promising means for PE teacher education. This refers in particular to autonomous work in teacher education because in the present study the pre-service teachers reflected on the teaching examples by themselves. © 2020 Association for Physical Education.","case-based learning; examples; game-centered approach; physical education; Teacher education","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85096608055"

This study aims to validate the core components of a dynamic model (Film's Interest-Raising Mechanisms [FIRM] model) that describes how pupils' interest in a video and the educational content is the result of their appraisals of video characteristics. The five appraisals in the model represent characteristics of learning materials and activities, of films and videos, and of games that have been found to potentially raise interest: Novelty and complexity, comprehensibility, complex developments, rewarding closure, and absorption. We empirically tested the use of four videos in six 12th-grade science and mathematics classrooms (151 pupils) using pre- and post-tests, and path-modeling.

It has prevented students from performing group-oriented hands-on activities and has eventually transformed their active learning environment in schools into virtual passive lectures at home. Therefore, to solve this impedance, we exercised several online STEM programs (five online STEM programs with repetitive cycles) for school students, including 140 students (middle and high school), 16 undergraduate (UG) secondary mentors, and 8 primary STEM professionals. Thus, the study revealed the results of a distinctive interactive online STEM teaching model that has been designed to overcome the virtual classroom’s impediments. The employed teaching model demonstrates an interactive learning environment that ensures students’ engagement, retention, and participation, driving them to STEM innovations. Various digital tools, including PowerPoint presentations, videos, online simulations, interactive quizzes, and innovative games were used as teaching aids. Both the synchronous and asynchronous means in a student-centered approach, along with the feedback mechanism, were implemented. Finally, the employed method’s effectiveness was revealed by the maximum student retention and STEM innovation rates, along with the model’s potentiality towards its replicability and sustainability. Thus, the outlook of such initiatives could further be broadened by its sustainability and replicability aspect towards vulnerable student communities such as academically introverted and specially challenged students. © 2021 by the authors.

A systematic and structured video analysis of twenty-six children's game play was carried out focussing on moments where children made an error and were followed by in-game feedback. Our findings show that children benefited from outcome feedback, which supported an accurate interpretation of their game performance and prompted children to try again. In contrast, though the elaborative feedback attracted similar levels of attention, children struggled to understand the content, resulting in a reliance on implicit knowledge to correct their next response. Alongside identifying a set of new questions for future research, the study contributes a number of intrinsic and extrinsic recommendations for ensuring children with reading difficulties attend to and comprehend games-based feedback. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic? Outcome and elaborative feedback provided in games can scaffold the learner to recognise errors and apply corrective strategies. Elaborative feedback, in particular, has been evidenced to support the learner's understanding and lead to learning gains, albeit with older populations. What this paper adds? An empirical evaluation of how young children who struggle with reading attend to, understand, and respond to feedback in a digital literacy game. Demonstrates that children attend to the outcome and elaborative feedback to equal degrees, but struggle to understand and apply elaborative feedback due to its metalinguistic complexity. Implications for practice and/or policy? Games that embed outcome feedback visually in the target response can enhance the child's attention to, and understanding of, their performance. Games that offer verbal elaborative feedback require additional instruction to maintain children's focus on the feedback and to support content understanding. © 2021 The Authors.

A specifically designed online survey was administered to a hundred primary-school EFL teachers in some regions of Italy, Romania, and Spain in May/July 2020, and a comparative analysis of the responses was conducted to examine how teachers bore the brunt of the pandemic in areas that were severely affected by it. Results suggest that educators were somehow prepared to face distance learning in terms of resources and materials. During the lockdown they used synchronous video-conferencing tools and online games more extensively. Although they struggled to monitor children’s progress and to maintain motivation throughout the school closures, educators seem ready to implement these tools and strategies in future blended teaching. However, educators admit to lack specific training aimed at learning how to implement EFL online teaching, and they are concerned about its efficacy with young learners. Copyright: © 2021 M.

Physical education (PE) teachers were faced with the challenge of conveying at a distance the learning content that they would otherwise teach in the sports hall. Our research aimed to determine which PE distance learning models proved to be the most effective during the epidemic, resulting in a high level of pupils’ activity despite participation from home. In the process of data collection, we included 33 PE distance learning lessons at the lower secondary level, where six pupils (3 girls and 3 boys) wore accelerometers in each lesson (n = 198 pupils). The results showed that the most effective model was the flipped learning teaching model, where pupils were given an overview in advance of the different forms of teacher video recordings. Then they also actively participated with their ideas in the performance of the online lesson. A statistically significantly less efficient version of the flipped learning teaching model had prepared interactive assignments and games. This was followed by a combination of online frontal teaching with station work and frontal teaching. The least effective was independent work carried out by the pupils according to the instructions prepared by the teacher. Although the two flipped learning teaching models were the most effective in terms of exercise intensity, it is very difficult to implement them in practice because they require too much teacher time. © 2021, University of Ljubljana.

In fact, incorrect learning is caused because the educational system does not take into consideration the accessibility parameters that people with dyslexia need to maintain a sustainable educational level equal to others. Moreover, the use of mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, has been deployed in education programs, offering many benefits; however, the lack of accessibility of those devices creates new barriers to students with dyslexia that hinder their education. With the aim of reducing these barriers, this paper presents an approach to the development of accessible serious games games for children with dyslexia. As a case study, a serious game based on a previously proposed serious game development method and a new set of accessibility guidelines for people with dyslexia is presented. The main purpose of the serious video game is to improve the treatment of dyslexia, through the collection of data obtained from two puzzles designed to train certain cognitive areas that affect this disability. This article has a double contribution: on the one hand, the guidelines and the method that can help video game developers and therapists to develop accessible serious games for people with dyslexia and, on the other hand, the two specific serious games that can be used by therapists, family members and people with dyslexia themselves. © 2021 by the authors.

The study maps out the gaming habits, experiences, and perceptions of Pakistani high school students regarding incidental English vocabulary acquisition through online multiplayer video-games. The data collection tools consist of an online questionnaire and semi-structured interviews with selected participants. 88 Pakistani high school students responded to the online survey while 23 students volunteered to take part in the interview out of which five students were selected based on their responses to the survey. The survey data has been quantitatively analyzed and supplemented by thematic narrative analysis of the interview data. The findings show a consensus on the positive role of video games in incidental vocabulary acquisition due to the pressure-free context, increased attention and engagement, and transition from incidental learning to incidental self-directed learning. The interview students reported the expansion of vocabulary, real-life interactions in English, and increased awareness of teenage culture and vocabulary as the most effective English language learning outcomes of their involvement in the games.

Recently, brain-computer interface (BCI)-AO game rehabilitation, which combines AO therapy with BCI technology, has been introduced to improve the effectiveness of rehabilitation. This approach can improve motor learning by providing feedback, which can be interactive in an observation task, and the game contents of the BCI-AO game paradigm can affect rehabilitation. In this study, the effects of congruent rather than incongruent feedback in a BCI-AO game on mirror neurons were investigated. Specifically, the mu suppression with congruent and incongruent BCI-AO games was measured in 17 healthy adults. The mu suppression in the central motor cortex was significantly higher with the congruent BCI-AO game than with the incongruent one. In addition, the satisfaction evaluation results were excellent for the congruent case. These results support the fact that providing feedback congruent with the motion of an action video facilitates mirror neuron activity and can offer useful guidelines for the design of BCI-AO games for rehabilitation.  © 2021, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.","AON/MNS activation; BCI-AO game rehabilitation; congruent character movements; mu suppression","Brain-Computer Interfaces; Female; Healthy Volunteers; Humans; Male; Mirror Neurons; Movement; Neurological Rehabilitation; Software; Young Adult; brain computer interface; female; human; male; mirror neuron; movement (physiology); neurorehabilitation; normal human; procedures; software; young adult","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85112244337"

Although some people may simply “twitch” faster than others, the limit to Tetris expertise is not raw keypress time but the techniques acquired by players that allow them to use the tools provided by the hardware and software to compensate for the game's relentlessly increasing drop speed. Unfortunately, these increases in drop speed between Tetris levels make performance plateaus very short and quickly followed by game death. Hence, a player's success at discovering, exploring, and practicing new techniques for the tasks of board preparation, board maintenance, optimal placement discovery, zoid rotation, lateral movement of zoids, and other tasks important to expertise in Tetris is limited.

Research has demonstrated that youths who are socially vulnerable and at risk for behavioral health problems benefit from participation in these programs. However, much remains unknown about the mechanisms that contribute to youths’ capacity to develop life skills and their ability to transfer and apply life skills in other life domains. Method: Thirteen youths who engaged in the study participated in a sport-based PYD program, completed pretest and posttest surveys, entered the program with below-average life skills, and demonstrated growth in life skills pre-to-post program. Using a case study methodology, semistructured interviews explored life skill development, and photo-elicitation interviews explored life skill transfer. Results: Findings revealed specific mechanisms that co-contributed to and uniquely supported life skill development and transfer. For instance, participants explained that program staff framed, facilitated, and debriefed activities to promote the development and transfer of life skills. However, findings revealed that certain learning and transfer contexts—including faithbased organizations and video games—provided unique opportunities for life skill development and transfer. Conclusions: To maximize learning, community sportbased PYD programs should provide activities to develop and transfer life skills, train staff to use facilitative coaching strategies, and collaborate with key social agents (e.g., parents/caregivers, teachers, coaches) in other learning and transfer contexts. © 2021 Society for Social Work and Research.

There is a dearth of research specifically focused on students' perception and lived experience of a serious game, which is a game primarily designed for educational purposes. This qualitative study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of using a serious game to teach hazard and safety assessments in community and residential healthcare settings. Using a phenomenological approach semi-structured interviews collected data about students' experience using the game ‘Safe Environments’. Eight students from undergraduate healthcare programs participated. Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis was conducted. Themes and sub-themes identified nuances explaining the impact of prior knowledge, technical ability, and engagement on achievement of learning outcomes. The dynamic interrelationship and influence of themes are illustrated in the KNavEL Model, which explains the complexity of individuals' understanding and perceptions of learning through gaming. This study demonstrates that learning outcomes are directly influenced by the degree of engagement with the game. This in turn is influenced by what the student brings to the game by way of knowledge, experience navigating technology, and the subject matter.

This study focuses on the benefits of using digital tablets to foster this learning during a university teaching module in futsal with students in the second year of a sports science bachelor's degree. We compare the knowledge mobilized by these students during self-confrontation interviews (based on video recordings of the sessions), game situations, reciprocal coaching and debates of ideas. We then identify the nature of this knowledge and the strategies for its mobilization in context using a framework mainly based on didactics in physical education (Amade-Escot, 2006; Armour, 2011) and on pedagogical content knowledge studies (Shulman, 1986). The students were divided into two experimental conditions following the same pedagogical curriculum. The students in condition 1 used digital tablets to film themselves, tag videos and discuss the recordings. The students in condition 2 did not use tablets. The interviews were conducted twice during the teaching module: First during period 1 (beginning of the module) and then during period 2 (end of the module). The results show that students in condition 1 were more likely to mobilize shared knowledge, make decisions through cooperation and even devolve the construction of tactical reasoning and knowledge by their peers following the didactic approach of the faculty teacher as early as period 1. This promoted access to the construction and meaning of teaching and learning content. These results are discussed in light of the current challenges within educational systems and of the joint development of interactional skills for learning to cooperate and even to teach.  © 2021 Maël Le Paven et al., published by Sciendo.","cooperative learning; digital technologies; sport pedagogy; Student education; team sports teaching","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85108208509"

This 2-dimensional computer game is designed to help students learn Newtonian physics and uses stealth assessment to measure, in real-time, their physics understanding. The game operates according to Newtonian mechanics where students draw simple machines (e.g., ramps, levers, pendulums, and springboards), or adjust sliders to manipulate physics parameters to solve problems. Over the past three years, a team of experts in measurement, assessment, learning sciences, game design, and physics education has iteratively examined how to enhance students’ learning during gameplay. We incorporated supports for both physics understanding and game mechanics. Some of our designs showed promise while others did not and were discarded. Through three usability studies and a final learning study, we document the design, development, and testing of the final set of supports that involve modeling (Worked Examples, Physics Videos), modality (Animations, Formulas, Definitions, Hewitt Videos), and advice (Hints). We conclude with a discussion of the impact of incorporating learning supports, students’ perceptions of the learning supports, and the lessons learned through our iterative process. Jim shared our passion for supporting student learning and we hope that by sharing our journey we spur others on to continue the work he loved. © 2020, International Artificial Intelligence in Education Society.","Game-based learning; Learning supports; Physics education; Physics playground; Stealth assessment","Animation; Iterative methods; Machinery; Students; Design and Development; Iterative process; Learning science; Newtonian mechanics; Newtonian physics; Physics education; Student learning; Usability studies; Computer games","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85084196973"

I designed and implemented an LP creation assignment in two English Literature classes that focused on digital children's literature and culture. I imagined my LP assignment as a variation on a cognitive ""think-aloud"" activity, wherein students and/or instructors vocalize their approach to solving a particular problem. I was curious how these habits of mind might differ when students engage with interactive digital texts as opposed to print literature. What this study exposed is the centrality of feelings-in particular, ""bad"" feelings like anxiety and frustration, and the silences that often accompany these feelings-to the initial stages of critical thinking. When students contemplated bad feelings and their origins, eventually they were able to offer incisive analyses of their digital texts. Ultimately, this study argues that cognitive and affective ""think-and-feel-aloud"" activities such as the LP exercise, which allow students to dwell momentarily in bad feelings and silence, create rich teaching and learning opportunities. © 2021 University of Calgary.

In addition, few studies have considered the reception of feedback by an athlete, or the characteristics of the athlete that may support or hinder feedback reception. The purposes of this study were threefold. First, to examine the characteristics of feedback provided by a coach during a typical video feedback meeting. Second, to measure the impact of this feedback on athlete learning. Third, to consider a range of learner characteristics that may impact feedback reception. Six coaches and six players affiliated with an Australian Football League (AFL) club were recruited. Coach-player dyads were observed in one-to-one video feedback meetings following a game played in the 2017 season. Players were interviewed to test feedback recall. Players also completed a series of tests designed to measure learner characteristics, with the intention of discovering moderating factors of the relationship between feedback and learning outcomes. Rates of feedback generally mirrored those found in previous studies. Coaches provided nearly 30 feedback messages during each meeting. Players recalled 50% of summarised feedback messages but just 6% of all feedback a week later. A ceiling effect on learner characteristics was observed. The paper presents a novel design for examining feedback effectiveness while considering learner characteristics. Given the findings on feedback quantity and recall, coaches are encouraged to adopt a ‘less is more’ approach to providing feedback. © The Author(s) 2020.","Coach-athlete dialogue, learning, self-efficacy, working memory capacity","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089465288"

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of lecture method and virtual reality-based serious gaming (VRBSG) method on students learning outcomes about the approach to coma. Methods: We adopted a randomized trial method for this study and selected 50 medical students dividing them into experimental and control groups. Students’ learning outcome was measured with a 10-item test. Serious game usability scale was used to evaluate the usability of the serious game. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used for data analysis by SPSS-22 software. Results: Students’ familiarity with e-learning and VRBSG was low. The mean usability of a VRBSG was 126.78 ± 10.34 out of 150. The majority of students were eager to be instructed through VRBSG. The mean score of learning outcomes in the experimental group was significantly higher than the control group (t = − 2.457, P = 0.019). Conclusion: Students’ learning outcomes in the VRBSG group in the test approach to coma were significantly better than the lecture group. The usability of the serious game instruction method was high.

Following a STEAM approach, the workshop aimed to engage participants in age-appropriate activities that focus on CT skills through the lens of creating their own game. A web-based game design interface that allows students to code and play games as simulated on a skyscraper was developed to support the workshop's core activities. The web environment also featured step-by-step tutorials and fully functional games to promote the accessibility of the learning materials for a diverse body of students and educators around the globe. The results of the study indicated that the workshop helped students improve their CT skills and differentially influence their attitudes towards computing. In particular, the workshop experience led students from underserved community districts to lower their attitude ratings, whereas the reverse pattern was observed for students from more affluent districts. The workshop reportedly informed students' perception of computing as a profession and their appreciation of the analytical effort required for developing functional games. Qualitative analysis of artifact-based interviews indicated that students could begin to make abstractions and devise algorithms by associating variables through conditional statements while solving problems related to game development. Interview analysis also revealed that students took pride in the effort that they made during the workshop. © 2021, Association for Educational Communications and Technology.","Computational thinking; Computer science education; Game design; STEAM","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85111845107"

In this approach, the students learn the video-based subject content prior to in-class session and participate in collaborative learning activities during the class. The class time is utilized for activities, games and discussion. This model is increasingly used for teaching and learning purpose in developed countries where technology is highly integrated in education. This article is meta-analysis of already conducted experimental studies to highlights the academic, social and emotional development of students during experiments. The reviewed articles were searched on 4 data bases and 12 journal articles, based on experimentation. These articles contained a variety of the subjects taught to students from primary level to Higher education. The results suggested that students in flipped classroom were more active, engaged, motivated, and interactive and academically they were better performer. It is concluded that flipped classroom model increases academic achievement and improve social and emotional development of students. However there are some limitations of the flipped classroom model as students are not aware of self-learning/autonomous learning. Teachers need training for material selection, development, and presentation in videos. The review of qualitative researches would explore more benefits of flipped class rooms on learning, behavior, attitude and personality of the students. © 2021, Shaheed Benazir Bhutto Women University.

The balance task is modeled as a meta game, a game where actions change the rules of another base game. Based on the model of Reinforcement Learning (RL), an agent assumes the role of a game master and learns its optimal policy by playing the meta game. In this new methodology we extend traditional RL by adding the existence of a meta environment whose state transition depends on the evolution of a base environment. In addition, we propose a Multi Agent System training model for the game master agent, where it plays against multiple agent opponents, each with a distinct behavior and proficiency level while playing the base game. Our experiment is conducted on an adaptive grid-world environment in singleplayer and multiplayer scenarios. Our results are expressed in twofold: (i) the resulting decision making by the game master through gameplay, which must comply in accordance to an established balance objective by the game designer; (ii) the initial conception of a framework for automatic game balance, where the balance task design is reduced to the modulation of a reward function (balance reward), an action space (balance strategies) and the definition of a balance space state. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Computer games; Dynamic difficulty adjustment; Multi agent systems; Reinforcement learning","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85078048588"

Students had to embrace on-line learning despite their unpreparedness and the challenges thereof. This article reports on mathematics students' on-line collaboration on game-based learning. Participants were a cohort consisting of 52 Bachelor of Education mathematics students in their second year of study. They were randomly placed in groups, and had to interact on-line to create a board game on aspects of the intermediate phase of the mathematics curriculum. Each group submitted an explanation of their board game and a video on how the game works. Thereafter, students completed individual reflective narratives on their group collaboration and contribution of members. This was followed by individual task-based questions on the game by twelve selected participants. A deductive coding approach was followed to analyse the data.

This randomized control trial study on natural selection challenges that assumption. This study answers the question of whether learning STEM in an immersive 3D VR environment is always superior to learning via a 2D monitor (PC). This is a 2 × 2 × 3 design. The first factor is platform immersivity (low = 2D PC, or high = 3D VR), the second factor is level of embodiment (lower = watching playback video, or higher = using mouse/controller to agentically manipulate content), and the third factor is test time (pretest, posttest, and follow-up). There was a significant main effect for embodiment, the high embodied and agentic groups learned the most. There was not a main effect for platform, because the participants in the low embodied VR group performed significantly worse than the three other groups. Although, the one high embodied, VR group learned and retained the most knowledge. A path-analysis revealed that the effect of platform was significantly mediated by presence, agency, and engagement. The smaller learning gain in the low embodied VR condition suggests that participants come to the immersive VR experience with expectations about agency and control of the virtual content, and when those expectations were not met, the disconnect was deleterious for learning. More agentic and interactive control of manipulable virtual content is encouraged. Design is critical, and platform is not destiny. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","game design; learning in XR; natural selection; STEM education; Virtual Reality design; VR; XR","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85107308953"

However, one solution to this problem is the incorporation of digital pedagogical strategies based on gamification, which promote interest, facilitate the learning process, and contribute to reducing dropout. In this sense, we evaluated the student’s preference for using the gamified tool Didactic City, by using a quantitative methodology and structural equation models. This preference included fundamental factors such as utility, knowledge, engagement, enjoyment, motivation, and ease of use. The results are expected to contribute to create a more informed decision-making process not only for video game designers but also for pedagogues, and educational managers who could perform game improvements, redesigns, inclusion, or exclusion of individual elements that would make students prefer to use gamification tools in the future. The results indicate that the students’ utility, the enjoyment generated by the tool, and the improvement of knowledge are the critical factors in terms of preference for using gamified tools in virtual learning environments. Implications for policy and practice: • In virtual learning environments, higher education institutions and instructors can include gamified tools to create pleasant environments that increase students’ motivation and facilitate learning. • Designers and developers of gamified educational tools should measure their acceptance, as this factor is decisive for fulfilling the purposes of these pedagogical tools. • Researchers could evidence more factors that influence the preference for the use of gamified educational tools. © 2021.

The learning objectives targeted enriching a mental model that students could use to explain the causal relationship of the ETC common misconceptions students hold. Eighth graders (N = 120) participated in a one-day activity using a video and game designed by the researchers to model ETC. This model explained how sunlight energy was converted into ATP involving a flow of electrons. A quasi-experimental design involved a pre-test/post-test essay where students from the two treatments - video only and video+game - were asked to interpret a diagram about ETC. Playing Electron Chute after watching the video was effective on addressing misconceptions about sunlight absorption by chlorophylls, oxygen, ATP and NADPH production and the electron flow during ETC. A survey collected data about students’ experiences after the video+game treatment. The majority of students agreed that playing the game increased their ability to explain how plants use light energy. This study demonstrates a principled approach for designing a video and game to support students’ ability to make sense of how complex systems work. © 2020 Royal Society of Biology.","electron transport chain; Informal learning; photosynthesis; serious game; stem; video","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85090150617"

We investigated how culture may relate to acceptability of GBL in undergraduate students. We performed online, survey-based research with 489 undergraduate students (66.9 % female) at a Canadian university to assess how their (1) level of Canadian identity (cultural integration) and (2) other cultural associations (e.g., East Asian, South Asian, Middle Eastern, European, North American) related to students' views on GBL, while adjusting for prior gaming exposure and gender. We found that perceptions of Canadian identity were strongly and positively related to views on GBL, which can be explained by Canadians' affinity to playful learning opportunities and familiarity with video-gaming. Students who identified as East Asian had the most positive views compared to all other cultural groups, irrespective of their integration in Canadian culture. Surprisingly, previous gaming exposure was negatively associated with the acceptability of GBL, though this relationship became more positive as students’ identification with Canadian culture increased. Males had overall more positive views on GBL than females. Our findings give insight into cultural considerations for the design and evaluation of GBL for international populations. Our results are limited by the small sample sizes of certain cultural sub-groups, treating ordinal variables as ratio in our regressions, and through defining and assessing culture based on geographical regions. Future research should assess culture more broadly and survey populations internationally and especially from underrepresented cultural groups. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Cultural and social implications; Games; Media in education; Teaching/learning strategies","Geographical regions; Surveys; Cultural groups; Cultural Implications; Game; Game-based Learning; Game-based learning environments; Media in education; Social implication; Teaching/learning strategy; Undergraduate students; University classrooms; Students","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85112517390"

Particularly within the action-adventure genres, entire missions (e.g. Monster Hunter: Generation Ultimate, 2018) or even full storylines (e.g. Spyro: The Reignited Trilogy, 2018) can require players to traverse an active volcano. With modern advancements in video game capabilities and graphics, many of these volcanic regions contain a lot of detail. Most video games nowadays have gameplay times in excess of 50ĝ€¯h. The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (2017), for example, brags a minimum of 60ĝ€¯h to complete. Therefore, players can spend a substantial amount of time immersed within the detailed graphics and unknowingly learn about volcanic traits while playing. If these details are factually accurate to what is observed in real-world volcanic systems, then video games can prove to be a powerful learning tool. However, inaccurate representations could instil a false understanding in thousands of players worldwide. Therefore, it is important to assess the accuracies of volcanology portrayed in mainstream video games and consider whether they can have an educational impact on the general public playing such games or whether these volcanic details are overlooked by players as they focus solely on the entertainment factor provided. We have therefore reviewed several popular commercial video games that contain volcanic aspects and evaluated how realistic said aspects are when compared to real-world examples. It was found that all the games reviewed had a combination of accurate and inaccurate volcanic features and each would vary from game to game. The visual aesthetics of these features are usually very realistic, including lava, ash fall and lahars. However, the inaccuracies or lack of representation of hazards that come with such features, such as ash-related breathing problems or severe burns from contact with molten lava, could have great negative impacts on a player's understanding of these deadly events. With further investigations assessing the direct impact on the general public, there is an opportunity to correctly assess how to incorporate the use of mainstream video games in educational systems and outreach. © Author(s) 2021.","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85118403929"

To conduct an innovative workshop activity using plastic building blocks to create a student-centric environment that encouraged development of creative thinking skills and self-reflection in under-graduate pharmacy students. Methods. Students were randomly allocated into small groups of four and assigned the role of either architect or team builder and tasked with creating a LEGO robot. Students were not allowed to speak during the activity. The architect was tasked with providing instructions to team builders on how to build the robot using nonverbal communication. After completion of the task, each group was asked to reflect on the exercise and share what they learned with the entire class. These discussions were video recorded and thematically analyzed. Results. The metaphorical models that students built served as a basis for discussion, problem-solving, and decision-making. Students described how this activity enabled them to mentally and visually link abstract concepts, such as decision-making and problem-solving, to actual practice. Three themes were identified from the qualitative study: thinking with hands, listening with eyes; linking theory to practice; and learning through reflection. Conclusion. This activity offered a non-confrontational way to support communication and the learning process.

I adapt the post-critical lens of Greg Ulmer and the institutional theories of Warren Beaty from comics studies to advocate for a shift of how we identify both games and scholarship. The result, hopefully, is not only a new tool for the analysis of games, but a functional definition of video games that allows this new tool a place within the form. This article begins with examples from some of the most popular games in the world that demonstrate that games can and do merge aesthetics and mechanics to convey either implicit learning or an explicit argument in combination with entertainment. Next, I outline a theoretical framework of post-criticism for games, a perspective that helps us to understand the legitimacy of such an approach. A survey of the definitional debate in games studies and a brief outline of some of the problems therein contextualizes the value of an institutional approach to the question of “What is a game?” Finally, I explore how a post-critical framework and institutional definition of games provides a fresh outlook that incorporates a new medium into scholarship and defines games in a way that causes us to ask, “what makes this example interesting?” rather than “does it fit?. © 2021 The Author(s).

Though video games have been presented as tools that could capitalize on youth’s interest-driven engagement with technology to support situated modes of civic learning, their actual contributions remain contested. This conceptual paper sets out to update and expand existing approaches to the civic role of video games by offering a “connected civic gaming” framework. Connected civic gaming brings together two approaches: first, “connected civics” highlights the potential of digital technologies to create consequential connections between youth’s interest driven cultural participation and civic modes of action. Second, “connected gaming” stresses the importance of positioning youth not only as game-players but also as makers of video games and active participants in the emerging communities that surround them. Accordingly, we offer a classification of the diverse civic contributions of game-playing and making, calling for two main shifts in research on civic video games: (1) overcoming the depiction of games as standalone interventions, and integrating them in broader educational efforts; and (2) a stronger emphasis on offering youth decision making power in- and about the games they play. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","civic education; connected gaming; connected learning; game making; transfer; Video games","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85076900336"

With the increasing development of new technologies, promising innovations can be implemented enhancing learning and improving success rates. In this study, a new learning interactive method is proposed and evaluated using the experience of over 600 students of Mechanical Engineering. This study describes a 4-year experiment based on new interactive applications for education. The experiment has been implemented using E-learning techniques and new technologies (a combination of remote and virtual examples, videos, quizzes, and theory). Specifically, several applications have been programmed to be executed on different devices, such as mobile phones and PC/laptops (Android and Windows). The experiment is applied using small applications that help the students identify the most challenging contents and guide them throughout step-by-step. The main objective of this interactive method is to help students find their lack of knowledge and offer them contents to cover it. These didactic applications are portable and intuitive. Thanks to these interactive applications, it is possible to accomplish better practices of “E-learning” and “Computer Simulation and Animation” together. Since they are portable applications, they allow the student to interact and check conceptual understandings at any place. Students really appreciate this aspect. The results of the course titled Mechanism and Machine Theory have been analyzed during these four last years in which these interactive applications have been offered to the students. © 2021 The Authors.

The analysis was based on variation theory and Chi’s taxonomy of learning activities. Two Swedish preschool teachers’ enactment of the same mathematical activity for 27 children aged 4–6 years was studied. Video recordings of what the children were offered to discern were used in the analysis. The results indicate that variations in how the teachers chose to enact the activity produced two different learning opportunities for the children. Differences in what aspects were made discernible were closely linked to the characteristics of the activity implemented. The enactments differed even if the same game was chosen and the same amount of time was used in the play-based activity. In one preschool group, there were few opportunities to discern more than the nominal form of numbers; the other preschool group had an activity focused on all number forms simultaneously. In addition, in the latter group, the children had the opportunity to develop equinumerosity. The results suggest that the activity with limited variation was more appropriate for learning with undeveloped knowledge; the children with more developed understanding required a more varied design. This study contributes to the knowledge of how the design of an activity affects children’s learning differently, which is important when planning learning-based preschool activities. © 2020, The Author(s).","Cardinality; Equinumerosity; Number forms; Preschool mathematics","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85095429393"

Using an online questionnaire, we investigated how they managed distance learning in Physical Education (PE) at primary schools. The delivery mostly depended on whether the school included PE in the timetable. On average, most lessons took the form of independent student activity following written or recorded instructions, and the rest took the form of online outdoor or indoor live classes. The latter were often used to give instructions, check tasks and motivate. Some schools organized at least one sports day (26%), active break (21%) or active class break (9%). Most pre-service teachers chose different objectives compared to traditional form of instruction: They emphasized the development of motor and functional abilities rather than the acquisition of new motor and social skills. All student teachers delivered physical fitness, followed by athletics (59%), dance and aerobics (43%). However, ball games (except volleyball 33%) were represented in a smaller proportion. 21% of the students taught content continuously. Assessment was done by 71.4% of the students (many of them only assessed the completion of the tasks) and evaluation by only 31.0%. They used a workout diary, videos or photos, or live conference calls. The average response rate was 71% for 1st-6th graders and 59% for 7th-9th graders. 21% did not attempt to reach non-responding students, while 10% indicated that they did not have problems with nonresponding. © 2021, Croatian Anthropological Society.

Background: Despite the level of appeal of video games to college students, there is a lack of empirical evidence of how to design effective games to address educational goals. One component of games that can serve as a support mechanism to help players be successful in the game is the in-game tools. This article investigates the impact of three types of instructional in-game tools on engineering students' performance on digital circuit design tasks. Research Questions: To what extent do different types of in-game tools (content-specific instructional guidance tool, scaffold, and productivity tool) contribute to players' performance on digital circuit design tasks? Methodology: This article presents the design of an educational video game to teach digital circuits design. It presents three discrete types of in-game tools and investigates their impact on students' learning performance. For this investigation, multiple regression analysis was used to show the relations between the tools and learning performance ( {N}=176 ). Findings: The results show the player use of tools that provide content-specific instructional guidance and scaffolding for troubleshooting is correlated with their learning performance. The productivity tool did not significantly contribute to the learning performance of the students. © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Digital circuit design; digital system design; game-based learning; in-game tools; serious games; video games","Curricula; Design; Digital circuits; E-learning; Education computing; Human computer interaction; Integrated circuit manufacture; Productivity; Scaffolds; Three dimensional computer graphics; Timing circuits; Digital circuit design; Educational goals; Educational video games; Learning performance; Multiple regression analysis; Productivity tools; Research questions; Support mechanism; Students","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85100550596"

Current smoking cessation measures such as behavioral change counselling by trained professionals, nicotine replacement therapy and medications have limited success. Smoking intensity is assessed using a portable device to measure the smokers' exhaled breath carbon monoxide (eCO) level. A systematic review suggests the potential of serious gaming to increase smoking quit rate. However, the related studies were unable to explain and determine the effect gamification on smoking cessation. A handy personalized eCO measurement device linked to a smart-phone applications (app) has been developed (integrated STEADES-2 system). This novel system incorporates app-based video and print learning resources, authentication function and gamification using the eCO data as game element. Trained multidisciplinary healthcare professionals access the STEADES-2 data to monitor smoking status and support smokers via asynchronous virtual coaching. The pilot randomized controlled trial will enroll 20 smokers to use the STEADES-2 system (intervention group) and another 20 to the existing smoking cessation programme (control group) in primary care. The primary feasibility outcomes will include the recruitment response rate, the smokers' usability of the STEADES-2 system, their self eCO monitoring, frequencies of participation in the serious games and interactions with their virtual coaches. Their smoking literacy, utility and experience of the STEADES-2 system are other outcomes. Smokers in both groups will be compared on their cigarette abstinence as secondary outcome based on eCO levels and urine cotinine test (primary outcomes after 12 weeks).

However, in many cases, rapid intervention and appropriate behavior can significantly reduce this threat. For this it is important that people are properly trained. Faced with the economic, ecological and organizational requirements and constraints linked to fire safety training, virtual training environments appear to be a judicious alternative to traditional training. However, before committing companies to invest in expensive devices, it is necessary to ensure the effectiveness of such devices. The literature is rich and divided on this subject, and it appears that certain characteristics of the system and of the learners are decisive. In this context, the objective of our work was to study the effects of immersion, the feeling of presence as well as the interaction between these 2 factors on the performance of conceptual and procedural learning. Certain variables were also controlled such as gender, tendency to immersion, previous experience in computers and video games. Our work shows that immersion promotes procedural but not conceptual learning, and that neither the sense of presence, nor the interaction between immersion and the sense of presence affect these two types of learning in our training task. Apart from the knowledge of fire which potentiates the effect of immersion on procedural learning, the variables considered in our study (computer experience, video game experience and genre) had no impact on performance. Understanding the impact of the technical device or the characteristics of users on conceptual and procedural learning is a major challenge in helping trainers to develop pedagogical devices in order to better exploit the opportunities offered by new technological approaches. © 2021","Augmented and virtual reality; Human-computer interface; Media in education; Pedagogical issues","Activation analysis; Computer games; Fires; Virtual reality; Computer experience; Conceptual learning; Feeling of presences; Fire safety; Procedural learning; Sense of presences; Video game; Virtual training environments; E-learning","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85100782251"

This research was conducted through an experiment that included testing participants' progress (group 1) before and after completing a five-lesson plan using the aforementioned video game, this being compared with a group of 26 Chinese students (group 2). Based on the content of the selected lessons, the main purpose of this test was to determine the participants' initial level and then assess their progress considering the mistakes that they made regarding the word order structure, lexicon, grammar, spelling, and content. The results have shown that all the participants in group 1 progressed in the second test after completing the lessons through ImmerseMe, and their performances were generally better than those of group 2.

This article describes developing a STEM-based online course during the schools’ closure in the COVID-19 epidemic to combat the virtual science classroom’s limitations that could promise an active STEM learning environment. This learning model of the online STEM-based course successfully developed and exercised on 38 primary–preparatory students helped them to overcome the decline in their learning productivity. Various digital learning resources, including PowerPoint presentations, videos, online simulations, interactive quizzes, and innovative games, were implemented as instructional tools to achieve the respective content objectives. A feedback mechanism methodology was executed to improve online instructional delivery and project learners’ role in a student-centered approach, thereby aiding in the course content’s qualitative assessment. The students’ learning behavior provided concrete insights into the program’s positive outcomes, witnessing minimal student withdrawals and maximum completed assignments. Conclusions had been drawn from the course assessment (by incorporating both synchronous and asynchronous means), student feedback, and SWOT analysis to evaluate the course’s effectiveness. © 2021 by the authors.

A key goal in the Norwegian educational system is that such positive life skills become internalised in students. The aims of this study were to understand students’ experiences of and behaviour towards social inclusion – such as passing the ball – in team activities and how the teacher facilitated the learning of social inclusion. We use Dewey’s pedagogical perspective on education, and Johnson and Johnson’s cooperative learning model to discuss possible consequences and implications of our findings. The participants consisted of two secondary classes from two state schools in Norway, where one class was investigated in depth. Methods comprised written narratives, interviews, observation and video recordings of PE lessons. Data creation was triangulated, and thematic analysis was conducted. The results highlighted a paradox between students’ experiences of and behaviour towards social inclusion in team activities. Students disliked socially exclusive behaviours, but they often provided positive feedback when the behaviour was seen as successful in the context of a game; furthermore, students could themselves behave in a socially exclusive manner. Although the teacher could ‘teach by telling’ the students to pass the ball or by having rules, passing the ball did not become internalised in students. We discuss a model of ‘learning through experiences and reflections’, according to which students may learn to become socially inclusive beings. © The Author(s) 2021.","didactics; experiences; Physical education; social exclusion; social learning; team activities","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85103403488"

Here, the cloud must use massive resources for video representation and its streaming when several simultaneous players reach a particular point. Alternatively, various players may have separate necessities on Quality-of Experience, like low delay, high-video quality, etc. The challenging task is providing better service by the fixed cloud resource. Hence, there is a necessity for an energy-aware multi-resource allocation in the cloud. This paper devises a Fractional Rider-Harmony search algorithm (Fractional Rider-HSA) for resource allocation in the cloud. The Fractional Rider-HSA combines fractional calculus, Rider Optimization algorithm (ROA), and HSA. Moreover, the fitness function, like mean opinion score (MOS), gaming experience loss, fairness, energy consumption, and network parameters, is considered to determine the optimal resource allocation. The proposed model produces the maximal MOS of 0.8961, maximal gaming experience loss (QE) of 0.998, maximal fairness of 0.9991, the minimum energy consumption of 0.3109, and minimal delay 0.2266, respectively. © 2021 World Scientific Publishing Co.","Cloud computing; fractional calculus; harmony search algorithm; rider optimization algorithm; spark architecture","Calculations; Energy utilization; Learning algorithms; Power management; Quality of service; Resource allocation; Cloud-computing; Energy; Fractional calculus; Gaming experiences; Harmony search algorithms; Mean opinion scores; Optimization algorithms; Resources allocation; Rider optimization algorithm; Spark architecture; Optimization","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85116919503"

Materials and Methods: Twenty-six college students from 24 cities in 11 provinces of China were investigated for a week-long survey. According to grounded theory principles, we coded original records from 69 diary reports using qualitative analysis tools. Results: We constructed nine core categories from participants' journals and drew the mechanism chart of the game as a means of health communication. The results showed that participants had experienced (1) an iterative learning process based on the authenticity and multiperspective features of the game and obtained specific learning outcomes; (2) deep thinking through the association between the game and the real world. And we extracted variables that are highly predictive of behavior change, including cognition of seriousness, cognition of susceptibility, action clue, and self-efficacy. Furthermore, noncore categories (including emotions and gameplay) directly and indirectly impacted players' learning and behavior change. Conclusion: The study shows Plague, Inc. has played a positive role in health communication (mainly reflected in the improvement of players' cognitive level, the establishment of health belief, and behavior changes). Moreover, it is concluded that reflection plays an important role in health communication interventions. However, careful consideration should be given to the use of this game as a means of health intervention due to its limitations and certain deficiencies.  © 2021 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.","COVID-19; Health communication game; Health education game; Inc.; Plague","COVID-19; Grounded Theory; Health Communication; Humans; Plague; SARS-CoV-2; Video Games; grounded theory; human; medical information; plague; video game","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85120971805"

Similarly, researchers who are interested in the pedagogical value of game-based learning activities also emphasize self-reflexive player practices when discussing the benefits of incorporating video games into traditional educational environments. Problem.: Despite the shared interest in player self-reflexivity within ethics- and education-focused scholarship, qualitative research that explores the ability to design learning experiences around video games’ ethical dimensions is still in its emergent stages. Intervention.: This article bridges the gap between ethics and pedagogy by discussing the author’s experience designing a long-form writing assignment around Plague Inc: Evolved for a college-level English seminar. For this project, students first narrated how they refined personal gameplay strategies over the course of several game sessions. Students then discussed how the logic underlying their in-game strategies could be used to further enhance or refine the rationale they use to navigate complex real-world issues in their daily lives beyond the classroom. Results.: In undertaking this long-form writing project, students were able to use their self-reflexive gameplay strategies as an outlet for re-thinking how they interpret real-world problems. In doing so, students engaged in a form of ethical inquiry premised upon critical introspection. Conclusion.: This examination demonstrates how game-based writing assignments can help students reflect upon and revise the ethical reasoning they use to diagnose and solve complex real-world problems. © 2020 SAGE Publications.","ethical reasoning; ethics; pedagogy; Plague Inc: Evolved; player self-reflexivity","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85090243765"

Based on standardized exams (SAT Suite) and a survey of rural Michigan students in grades 8–11, we find that rural students with broadband home Internet access are more interested in school and leave homework incomplete less often. However, the relationship to classroom grades (GPA) is relatively trivial. Yet, we find that students who are not dependent on a cell phone for Internet access and those with higher digital skills, especially social media skills, rank considerably higher on the SAT. Rural students with broadband Internet access are able to participate in a more diverse array of online media activities, which supports building digital skills. Any negative relationship between time spent on social media, video games, other digital media and educational outcomes is outweighed by the benefit to digital skills. However, aspects of rural culture; including the emphasis on activities such as sports, as a path to postsecondary schooling and upward, social mobility; may be stunting the positive relationship between access, digital skills, and educational aspirations. Whereas extra-curricular sports have no direct relationship to SAT performance, students who spend more time on sports receive higher grades and have higher educational aspirations than those with more digital skills.

Explorez and VdeUVic are collaborative quest-based SLGs. At different locations on campus, players interact with characters that give them quests including clues or options to further the storyline. These interactions take place in the form of either written text, or audio and video recordings, encouraging students to develop language skills both written and oral. Students choose their own learning path and advance at their own pace. Three cohorts of FL2 university students play-tested the games, with 58 of the 77 students choosing to participate in the study. The design-based research framework for the development of the game iterations and subsequent testing was an iterative process with each stage producing output that became input for the next stage. The evaluation of the AR language tools was implemented by means of a mixed-method case study, collecting data of both a qualitative and quantitative nature, through pre and post-play questionnaires, interviews, and video recordings of student gameplay interactions for analysis. Informed by situated cognition, one of the goals was to provide a contextual and immersive learning experience. Additionally, this research drew on sociocultural theory and the social nature of language learning, emphasizing learner interactions as a principal learning force. This research examined the learners’ perceptions of their learning experience, as well as the ways in which students collaborated to complete the tasks. Employing a situative approach framework informed by social regulation and content processing, student learning patterns were examined. Distinct types of learner interactions amongst teams during gameplay were shown. Patterns in the emergence of learners’ high-level co-regulation during collaborative learning are indicated in the findings.

Background: Many believe that training on abstract computer-based exercises and video games enhances cognitive capacities to the benefit of performance in operational contexts. The basic research in this area is controversial. Method: We summarize reviews of the basic research data on transfer from training on abstract computer-based exercises and video games and undertake a detailed methodological review of flight and driving transfer studies. Results: Reviews of basic transfer research fail to reveal evidence of general transfer, although a few applied studies are said to show general transfer to driving or flight control. Our review of these applied studies identifies issues with research methods and data interpretation that compromise the credibility of their results to an extent that they do not provide robust evidence of general transfer from abstract computer-based exercises or video games. Conclusion: The state of cognitive training and video game training in relation to transfer has failed to meet early expectations. Much of the research in this area suffers from inadequate experimental control and flawed interpretation of results. We call for adherence to robust experimental design, critical evaluation of data patterns, and replication of keystone results. We also call for a theoretically grounded research effort, and we outline relevant theoretical conceptions of transfer. Application: A robust theory of transfer and better understanding of transfer effects can guide development of principles for design and use of training simulators. © 2019, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.","cognitive training; operational training; training simulators; transfer of training; transfer theory","Cognition; Humans; Laboratories; Video Games; Computer aided analysis; Computer games; Human computer interaction; Cognitive training; Operational training; Training simulator; Transfer of trainings; transfer theory; cognition; human; laboratory; psychology; video game; E-learning","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074072261"

Paired with audio/video conferencing and real data, students practiced measuring strike and dip, orienteering with a compass, matching landscape features with topographic maps, and tracing geologic contacts within the team structure typically employed in field camp. Open-source programs and tutorials freely available online assisted with constructing the Minecraft worlds. Assignments were aligned to the nine learning outcomes established for geology field camps by the National Association of Geology Teachers (NAGT). A pre-survey and post-survey quantified students' learning of the subject matter as well as perceptions towards Minecraft and online learning. We also held feedback sessions and conducted in-class, live observations to classify students' reactions and experiences during virtual activities. Overwhelmingly, students indicated they would have preferred an in-person field camp, yet they considered the Minecraft assignments exciting, important, interesting, and valuable. Regardless of perceived barriers, scores on subject matter questions increased from the pre- to the post-survey. Finally, observations illustrated how students' experiences in a virtual field camp recreated comparable components that students experience during an in-person field camp (e.g., students discussing career pathways, geological skills, and fostering interpersonal relationships). Because this virtual course achieved the curricular goals as well as the non-curricular goals and was relatively easy to construct, we recommend the usage of Minecraft for virtual geology courses in the future. © 2021 Erika Rader et al.","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85118395542"

Games have proven to be effective learning tools, and some studies have indicated positive links between creativity and other types of games, namely video games and role-playing games. However, less is known regarding board games’ potential benefits on creativity. This exploratory study compared two types of board games: creative and non-creative board games. We used a within-subject repeated-measurement design, in which participants played to both types of games, across two sessions separated by one week. We assessed creative potential with a divergent thinking task, using fluency and originality as indicators. We controlled for openness, mood states, and enjoyment. Results suggest an improvement of originality after playing both types of games, whereas no differences were observed for fluency. Considering the base level of participants, we found improvement for low-performing participants specifically, in both fluency and originality, although analyses’ limited statistical power may have impacted the findings. These findings provide a first step in the study of creativity and board games and suggest they could help temporarily improve one’s divergent thinking capacity. © 2021 Creative Education Foundation(CEF)","board game; creative potential; creativity; divergent thinking; game; training","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101812136"

Wearable technology enables the measurement of impact exposure. The validation of impact detection is required for accurate exposure monitoring. In this study, we present a method of automatic identification (classification) of head and body impacts using an instrumented mouthguard, video-verified impacts, and machine-learning algorithms. Methods: Time series data were collected via the Nexus A9 mouthguard from 60 elite level men (mean age = 26.33; SD = 3.79) and four women (mean age = 25.50; SD = 5.91) from the Australian Rules Football players from eight clubs, participating in 119 games during the 2020 season. Ground truth data labeling on the captures used in this machine learning study was performed through the analysis of game footage by two expert video reviewers using SportCode and Catapult Vision. The visual labeling process occurred independently of the mouthguard time series data. True positive captures (captures where the reviewer directly observed contact between the mouthguard wearer and another player, the ball, or the ground) were defined as hits. Spectral and convolutional kernel based features were extracted from time series data. Performances of untuned classification algorithms from scikit-learn in addition to XGBoost were assessed to select the best performing baseline method for tuning. Results: Based on performance, XGBoost was selected as the classifier algorithm for tuning. A total of 13,712 video verified captures were collected and used to train and validate the classifier. True positive detection ranged from 94.67% in the Test set to 100% in the hold out set. True negatives ranged from 95.65 to 96.83% in the test and rest sets, respectively. Discussion and conclusion: This study suggests the potential for high performing impact classification models to be used for Australian Rules Football and highlights the importance of frequencies <150 Hz for the identification of these impacts.

Materialist design is informed by a framework of materialist epistemology, which positions material innovation on equal placement with symbol-based formal theory. Historical examples of Einstein’s conceptual reliance on trains for his Theory of Relativity and the Wright brothers’ use of wind tunnels in aeronautics illustrate how materialist design drives progress on complex design problems. A key aspect is the application of scale-down methodology, where complex systems are reconceptualized as interactions among nearly decomposable subsystems that can be redesigned and integrated back into the entire system. The application of materialist design is illustrated with the redesign of an embodied video game that uses real-time motion capture technology to promote high school geometry reasoning and proof, following its use in an ethnically and linguistically diverse classroom. Our embodied perspective offers particular insights for understanding and implementing designs of complex learning environments, and assessing their influences on educational practices and student outcomes. © 2020, Association for Educational Communications and Technology.","Complex systems; Educational design; Embodiment; Learning theory; Scale-down","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85096084424"

Existing research in this area tends to show that gamified teaching experiences do contribute to significant effects to improve student cognitive, motivational, and behavioural learning outcomes, but these effects are usually small. In addition, less research examines how different types of mediated learning tools compare to one another in influencing student outcomes associated with learning and motivation. As such, a question can be asked in this area: how do video games compare to other types of mediated tools, such as videos or texts, in influencing student emotion outcomes? This study used an experimental design (N = 153) to examine the influence of different types of mass media modalities (text, video, and video game) on college students’ emotions in a mediated learning context. Research examining the impact of video games on instruction has begun to grow, but few studies appropriately acknowledge the nuanced differences between media tools in comparison to one another. Using a media-attributes approach as a lens, this study first compared these mediated tools along the attributional dimensions of textuality, channel, interactivity, and control. This study next tested the impact of each media type on thirteen emotion outcomes. Results showed that six emotion outcomes did not indicate differences between groups (fear, guilt, sadness, shyness, serenity, and general negative emotions). However, six of the tested emotion outcomes did indicate differences between groups with students experiencing higher levels of emotional arousal in both the text and video game conditions (in comparison to the video condition) for the emotions of joviality, self-assurance, attentiveness, surprise, hostility, and general positive emotions. Lastly, students also felt less fatigue in the video game condition. Overall, implications for e-learning suggest that when a message’s content is held constant, both video games and texts may be better in inducing emotional intensity and reducing fatigue than videos alone, which could enhance motivation to learn when teaching is mediated by technology. © 2021, Academic Conferences and Publishing International Limited.

The paper focuses on the discovery process, extending the skill acquisition model of Anderson et al. (2019) to address learning by discovery. The discovery process involves exploring the environment and developing associations between discontinuities in the task and events that precede them. The growth of associative strength in ACT-R serves to identify potential causal connections. The model can derive operators from these discovered causal relations just as does with the instructed causal information. Subjects were given a task of learning to play a video game either with a description of the game's causal structure (Instruction) or not (Discovery). The Instruction subjects learned faster, but successful Discovery subjects caught up. After 20 3-minute games the behavior of the successful subjects in the two groups was largely indistinguishable. The play of these Discovery subjects jumped in the same discrete way as did the behavior of simulated subjects in the model. These results show how implicit processes (associative learning, control tuning) and explicit processes (causal inference, planning) can combine to produce human learning in complex environments. © 2021","Causal inference; Cognitive architecture; Discovery learning; Skill acquisition; Video games","adult; article; associative learning; controlled study; female; human; human experiment; male; simulation; skill; video game","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85109464848"

They contribute to the generation of new social activities, and also become an innovative media space for the explication of artistic and aesthetic values, political meanings and educational practices. The aim of the study is the reconstruction and analysis of the cultural constitution of video games, revealing the features of their screen rhetorical capabilities, as well as revealing the educational potential of gamification practices and Digital Game Based Learning strategies. This is intended to form the competence-thematic framework of video games as a platform for modern media education. The methodological basis of the work is the cultural-historical and dialectical approaches, as well as the methods of systemic and structural-functional analysis. The study made it possible to trace the genesis of the cultural formation of video games, which demonstrated many strategies for their integration into the space of mass media culture. The main rhetorical models implemented in video games are analyzed. Particular attention is paid to the comprehensive consideration of procedural rhetoric as an original way of convincing the user through gameplay, interactive involvement in virtual practices. The foundations of the practice of gamification and the strategy of Digital Game Based Learning in education are considered. It identifies the possibilities of gamification as an innovative methodology for organizing incentives and rewards, and also identifies the range of difficulties and risks of total gamification of the educational process. Based on the results of the study, it was determined that video games use an original complex of rhetorical techniques that combine both traditional audiovisual formats of narrative, characteristic of other on-screen media, and procedural-interactive techniques. They made it possible to directly integrate the user into virtual narratives, turning them from a passive recipient into an actor. The importance of gamification as a tool for building strategies of internal stimulation with elements of entertaining practices in the dynamics of learning is also revealed, which increases the effectiveness of education. It has been revealed the significant educational potential of video games as a promising media platform in the framework of the implementation of the Digital Game Based Learning strategy. They can act both as carriers of knowledge and as a virtual environment for the formation of competencies in the field of history, economics, literature and social management. Procedural and rhetorical tools allow a person to become a part of an interactive scenario, which greatly increases the likelihood of assimilating information and developing professional skills. © 2021 LLC Ecological Help.

Nonetheless, it is not a complete perspective of this new educational trend. Mobile devices with many functions can be an effective tool to support learning. Furthermore, learners nowadays, who were born in the 4.0 movement, are more familiar with mobile devices than notebooks. They spend much time on their mobile phones interacting on social media and playing mobile games. Hence, if educators can integrate those interests into traditional lesson plans, added value would appear for learners' academic performance and learner autonomy. This paper proposes the idea of combining m-learning, gamification, and other factors influencing learning motivation into a mobile application to reinforce students' learner autonomy. With a case study at Nguyen Tat Thanh University, we take a closer look at the effectiveness of the application on students' language acquisition and a detailed description of how to best use the application along with lessons at schools. Using experimental methods with surveys and tests, this paper draws a bonding connection between students' personal interest in the subject and their performance. The study provides thoughtful insights into utilizing m-learning and gamification to improve students' learner autonomy and modernize language learning classrooms in this technological context. © 2021.

To achieve this goal, the researcher conducted a quasi-experimental pretest-posttest research design. The formation of the experimental group and control group employed the practice of convenience sampling. The experimental group experienced playing the selected mobile game during a weekly EFL class while the control group did not implement any mobile game during class time. Instead, the other students engaged in analog pronunciation games that paralleled the mobile games in terms of opportunities for language and pronunciation, but just in a different medium. The student participants in both the control and experimental groups were given a pretest before the treatment and a posttest after the treatment. These tests, along with qualitative measures, namely an interview and a questionnaire, revealed relevant results. The data illustrated that the experimental group showed significant improvements in their pronunciation skill. Thus, the students’ participating in the digital experimental group significantly benefitted from playing the mobile game, Thus, mobile gameplay can be considered an effective instructional tool, which can be used as an alternative resource in the EFL class where pronunciation is being taught as a learning objective. © 2021 Asociacion Mexicana de Maestros de Ingles MEXTESOL A.C.

This study seeks to find out how a group of Catalan-speaking gamers decided to start producing fan translations of video games from English into Catalan. Based on a digital ethnography (online interviews and observation of the group's activity), two types of analysis were conducted: A content analysis for recurrent trends and a focused analysis of internal metalinguistic discussions on the quality of translations. Results indicate that fan translators (1) organize hierarchically with set roles and functions, (2) curate their group identity and care for the promotion of Catalan as a vehicle for cultural production, (3) learn language incidentally in three ways: While translating (ensuring the comprehension of English and the linguistic quality and creativity of the transfer into Catalan), through sharing language doubts with their peers on their Telegram group and dialogically agreeing on pragmatically acceptable English-Catalan translations, and through metalinguistic discussions on translation tests received from potential new members. The study resonates with a novel subfield in computer-assisted language learning: Language learning in the digital wilds, which might be fertile ground for studies on incidental and informal language learning online. The study may also serve as inspiration for effective integration of translation into language classrooms in a manner that bridges vernacular fan translation and pedagogic translation, considering the importance of metalinguistic discussion for language learning and the sociocultural dimension of both translation and language learning. © 2020 The Author(s).

Methods: Eighty first-year dental students enrolled in the dental anatomy course were instructed to examine four stations. The stations included four versions of a mandibular first molar: an extracted natural tooth, a 3D printed model, a 3D virtual model, and a model displayed on a novel AR device. After examining all stations, the students were asked to complete an electronic survey. Bivariate analysis was performed to determine whether students’ perceptions are related to their demographic characteristics and technological experience with computer use, 3D modeling, and video games. Results: Seventy students completed the survey (87.5% response rate). Students rated natural teeth to have the highest educational value, the 3D printed tooth to be the most accessible, and the AR application to be the most interesting modality. Students who played little to no video games were more likely to rate AR as high educational value (48.8% vs. 10.3%; p < 0.001), while students with little 3D modeling experience were more likely to rate high accessibility of the 3D Model (78.1% vs. 48.3%; p < 0.001). No statistically significant associations between the perceptions and students’ demographic characteristics or use of computer were noted.

Using a quasi-experimental design, thirty (N = 30) sixth grade students were assigned to two groups based on their level of motivation for the domain of math (higher math motivation vs. lower math motivation). They then played a videogame involving mathematics fifteen times over a two-week period. During this time, participants’ in-game performances were recorded, along with their levels of motivation for the videogame and the domain of math. The results showed that the participants played the game at the same level of skill regardless of their initial level of motivation for the domain of math. Similarly, participants expressed high levels of interest, effort, pressure, and value for the game despite their varied levels of math motivation.

Additionally, this study is guided by two research objectives focusing on the nature (types) of interactions among players during the game and suggestions or responses from the instructors on the game including its physical outlook and processes. This research embarked upon a qualitative study where 4, 5 to 6 years old children attending a pre-school in Shah Alam were observed when playing ‘Buaya di Bawah Jambatan’. The sample was basically a group made up of 2 boys & 2 girls. The teacher assigned for the group became the instructor facilitating the whole process of playing the game. Data collected was mainly from the non-participant observations made by the researchers when the game was played. Video recordings too were made to capture the interactions observed during the whole session. Analysis were made both on the initial observation and the subsequent observations done on the recorded videos. The findings of this research revealed three major themes on peer interactions which include (1) learning to be with peers, (2) developing creative thinking and problem solving and (3) humour and laughter. The study also found that suggestions or responses from the instructor comprises both areas of improvements and strengths of the game. These findings are crucial to help teacher-educators to enhance their pedagogical skills and knowledge, particularly on learning adab and moral values in more fun, engaging and meaningful ways. Hence, learning adab and moral values among children should be more dynamic and relevant to children’s lives rather than applying solely on conventional approaches. It is hoped that this study opens more opportunities, insights, and ideas for other researchers to study peer interactions and its relations to games and learning adab with children in other populations such as among the marginalized community and B40 group as well as children with Special Educational Needs (SEN). © (2021), (Asian Journal of University Education (AJUE)).

However, high quality home healthcare clinical placements are often difficult to obtain, and arranging laboratory-based simulations to provide relevant clinical-practical learning experiences for all students is resource intensive. Objectives: The aim of this study was to explore nursing students' perceptions of using a blended simulation approach, including hands-on simulation with simulated patients and a video-based serious game, in preparation for their home healthcare clinical placements. Design: An exploratory qualitative design using focus group interviews was utilized. Setting and participants: Second- and third-year nursing students in home healthcare courses in Norway participated in this study. Methods: Five focus group interviews were conducted with a total of 26 nursing students. Data were collected over two semesters in three home healthcare courses. The data were analyzed using thematic content analysis. Results: The study identified four main themes that influenced students' perceptions of combining the two simulations. These included personal engagement, contextual and environmental factors, a safe and structured learning environment, as well as organizational and technical factors. In relation to the different themes, students expressed that disadvantages in one simulation were counteracted in the other. Conclusions: The blended simulation approach was perceived to address curricular objectives in different but complementary ways. The blended simulation approach was perceived to facilitate personal engagement and reflections and to provide relevant clinical-practical learning experiences. However, results also indicated that the organization of such a blended simulation approach (i.e., group compositions and size), facilitation from teachers, and technical issues (i.e., with medical equipment and the serious game) may influence students' perceptions and satisfaction directly. The results should provide useful information for designing future teaching strategies in Bachelor of Nursing programs. © 2020 The Author(s)","Blended learning; Home healthcare; Nursing education; Serious game; Simulation","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85100445311"

This article argues that historical videogames can and should be considered as a new and significant form of public history. Public history occurs outside formal learning contexts, involves the general public, is participatory and straddles history and heritage. Gaming embodies these qualities, offering the player a chance to explore the past in immersive and engaging ways, and for substantial periods of time as they play and re-play. Drawing on game studies, public history studies and education theory, this article offers a theoretical framework for understanding games as public history through three key concepts: the interactive archive; historical empathy; and affinity spaces. It takes Ubisoft Montpellier’s Valiant Hearts: The Great War (Ubisoft, 2014) as an illustrative case study. We explore why it has been highly acclaimed as an example of a ‘good’ historical game by both academic and popular sources, and what can be learned about the public reception of historical material from this. We argue that although Valiant Hearts is unconventional in its representation of war, its play mechanics build on established gaming conventions and, as a result, it is a valuable illustration of the affordances of videogames as public history practice. This article aims to enable public historians to understand the significance and nature of an under-analysed medium, and to offer game scholars tools for understanding the broader context of historical games as public practices of history-making. © 2001-2021 Game Studies.","affinity space; historical empathy; interactive archive; public history; World War One","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85128402887"

Examining youth technology use reveals sharp inequities within the United States’ education system and incongruencies between the technologies used in virtual schooling and those in the lives of students outside of school. In affluent communities, virtual schooling is supported by a distributed schooling infrastructure that coordinates students’ knowledge work. This home and school technology infrastructure features material, human, and structural capital that facilitates youth development as nascent knowledge workers. Technology use during virtual schooling keeps youth activity grounded within the “walls” of school; during virtual schooling, students have little voice in setting learning goals or contributing “content.” Technology use at home for learning or entertainment stems from their own goals and features them as active inquisitors seeking out information and extending their social networks, and crucially, using participatory learning technologies such as Discord for communications. An extended period of virtual schooling could enable a rethinking of the role of technology in schools, including an embrace of play, emotional design, participatory communications, place-based learning, embodied understandings, and creative construction. © The Author(s) 2021.","informal learning; pandemic; place-based learning; technology; video game; Virtual school","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85108826852"

Focusing on the intentional use of progressive-oriented video games (or “serious games”) towards educational aims, this paper sets out to go beyond this dichotomy by introducing the designability paradox of educational video games—arguing that video games’ designed nature both attenuates and accentuates the artificial and abstracted nature of conventional schooling. While video games are more authentic and situated in terms of the modes of participation available to players and intricateness of the simulative environment, they concurrently intensify the artificial and abstracted characteristics of conventional schooling as they represent an increase in the intentional design of learning environments and their separation from external contexts. Based on these analyses, the second part of the paper offers a more nuanced characterization of the types of authenticity and situatedness facilitated by educational video games along two axes: distinguishing between fictional and conceptual authenticity, and between situatedness that embeds or elicits learning. This classification is intended to offer a more nuanced understanding of learning in educational video games, and how they should be integrated into educational settings. Accordingly, the paper concludes by identifying three diverging foci of the integration of video games into classrooms: generalizing the learning taking place in the game, formalizing players’ in-game experiences, and contextualizing gameplay via critical analysis of the game. © 2021, Association for Educational Communications and Technology.","Authenticity; Game-based learning; Schooling; Situated learning; Transfer; Video games","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85104590452"

To increase the pool of creative thinkers, we need tools that can assess and support people's creativity. With advances in technologies, as well as in computer and learning sciences, we can create such support tools. In this study, we investigated the effectiveness of a creativity-support system that we developed in the level editor of an educational game called Physics Playground. Our goal was to improve college students' creativity. Participants (n = 114) were randomly assigned to one of four conditions and instructed to create as many creative game levels as possible in about two hours. The four conditions included: (1) Inspirational – with supports that provided access to a website with example levels, a brainstorming tool, and a remote association activity; (2) Instructional – with supports that provided specific instructions to first design as many levels as possible, then pick four of the levels, and enhance them using a tool called SCAMPER; (3) Both – with both inspirational and instructional supports; and (4) No Support, which did not include any creativity supports. The major finding from this research was that the Both condition was significantly more effective than the other conditions in improving students' creativity measured by the creativity of the game levels created by the students.

Parents/family and school were the most frequent sources of learning about self-care among the male and female respondents, respectively. Analyzing the participants’ statements regarding their own understanding of self-care activities, three major terms—“taking care of”, “avoid”, and “respect” were identified. When being ask about what they do for their own self-care, the results showed spending time on the Internet had the highest repetition rate among boys’ responses, followed by “going to gym”, “video games”, and “listening to music”. Regarding the desired activities, both girls’ and boys’ statements indicated that among leisure activities, “traveling” was the most frequent word, followed by being with friends.

They also provide digital information overlapped with augmented reality (AR), favouring immersive learning, coming from the interaction with several elements introducing activities. With this qualitative research-focused on cases study-we intend: a) to analyse 25 ILE created by pre-service teachers (N=95), intended to promote literary education and reading in preschool education. Two dimensions are considered: a) technological-interactive, describing the support and the AR resources, and b) educational and literary, identifying and quantifying the types of texts and activities. 2) To determine the satisfaction level of the preservice teachers at the end of the experience, by means of a survey. The results reveal that the ILE-based on literary texts-recreate fictional worlds with AR resources, bringing characters to life and including activities with and without AR. 64% of the ILE employ models, 24% a lapbook and the rest prioritise other supports, including AR coloring pages, videos, characters’ animations, online games, AR markers, QR codes, etc. The innovative experience became very satisfactory for pre-service teachers, who took profit of AR opportunities to design activities for literary education and to promote a playful and multisensory learning. © 2021 Centro de Estudios de PromociÃ³n de la Lectura y Literatura Infantil, Universidad de Castilla-La Manc.

Two versions of a mobile-based game about marine fishery management were created. Participants were 105 seventh-grade students in Taiwan. Research instruments included a Science Game Engagement questionnaire and a Marine Ecosystem and Sustainability Test. Students' interviews and classroom videos were also collected. Students' models of engagement were analyzed by using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling, and comparisons of subscales of engagement and learning outcomes were made by Analysis of Covariance statistics. The results showed that the students in the MPSG group had a higher level of behavioral engagement and better learning achievement than the students in the SPSG group did. Also, in exploring the interrelationships among the subscales of students' engagement, we found that, in the SPSG group, students' behavioral engagement was positively predicted by their emotional engagement, while in the MPSG group, it was positively predicted by their social engagement. In both groups, behavioral engagement predicted cognitive engagement. This finding was supported by the video data in that more interactions among the group members were observed in the MPSG group. This indicated that the multi-agent, dynamic modeling in the MPSG may have shifted the quality of the learners' social interactions. The affordances of participatory simulated games are discussed, and future research directions are provided. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Participatory simulations allow users to participate in simulations by controlling one of the roles in the system which models real-life settings. Dynamic modeling is an essential feature of participatory simulations that allows the learners to see the exact impact of their participation on changes in the system. Students who learned with the participatory simulations showed significantly better reasoning in concept building and fewer misconceptions than with conventional simulations. However learners can overly emphasize racing to win in multi-agent participatory simulations and tasks in participatory simulations can be too challenging for some learners. What this paper adds We compared students' engagement models in two versions of a participatory game–a multi-team participatory simulated game (MPSG) and a single-team participatory simulated game (SPSG). We found that in the MPSG social engagement predicted behavioral engagement while in the SPSG students' emotional engagement played an important role. Students who participated in the MPSG had better performance in system thinking than the students in the SPSG. Implications for practice and/or policy Dynamic modeling is not only authentic for simulating certain scientific phenomena but also it offers the affordances of improving the quality of learners' social interactions. This should be taken into account in the future design of educational simulations. A multi-team design of participatory simulation taking advantage of competition among teams and collaboration within teams can help students to learn complex phenomena. © 2021 The Authors.

In recent years, persistent gaps in delirium education have led to suboptimal delirium care. Still, little is known about what are the most important aspects of effective delirium education. Serious games are both entertainment and an interactive, safe learning environment where players can experiment and create new knowledge. They have the potential to contribute to improved delirium education. We used a video-based serious games' narrative to explore aspects essential to enhance students' attitudes and learning experiences regarding delirium. Methods: We created a semi-structured interview guide and interviewed seven nursing and nine medical students about their attitudes and learning experiences, after they had played the game. A qualitative descriptive design and inductive content analysis with constant comparison were used. Results: The patient's and nurse's perspective, interactivity to experiment, realistic views on care options, and feedback on care actions were important for enhancing students' attitudes and learning experiences regarding delirium. Students felt these aspects encouraged them to get actively involved in and experiment with the study material, which in turn led to enhanced reflection on delirium care and education. Our findings highlight the importance of a more patient-oriented focus to delirium education to drive attitudinal change. Students' learning experiences were further enhanced through their affective responses provoked by the perspectives, interactivity, realism, and feedback. Conclusions: Students considered the characters' perspectives, interactivity, realism, and feedback important aspects of the game to enhance their attitudes towards delirious patients and enrich their learning experiences. A patient-oriented narrative provides a clinically relevant experience in which reflection plays an important role. The serious game also serves as medium to actively experiment with care solutions to create better understanding of how healthcare professionals can influence a delirious patient's experience. © 2020 The Author(s).","Delirium; Education; Narrative; Serious game","Attitude; Delirium; Humans; Learning; Students, Medical; Students, Nursing; attitude; delirium; human; learning; medical student; nursing student","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85090180735"

Moreover, it looks into L2 learners' attitudes toward the integration of gaming into the English curriculum. To that end, a quantitative approach to data collection and analysis was employed. Responses were elicited using an online questionnaire that consisted of 29 items from 101 Arabic speaking students enrolled in an English and Translation bachelor program at a Saudi public university. The findings of the descriptive statistics (means and standard deviations) indicate that the participants positively perceive English learning through the medium of video games. According to students' views, several factors and elements conducive to English learning are recognized in commercial video games. These include knowledge of some aspects of English that are not taught in educational settings, predisposition to use English, more opportunities for practicing English, long-term retention of encountered-then-learned language points, independent learning, motivation to learn and deal with English, a comfortable environment for using English, and familiarity with vernacular Englishes. Meanwhile, the findings reveal that learners have positive attitudes toward the integration of gaming into the English curriculum, and they sanction the place of gaming in formal education, provided that current commercial video games need modifications to render optimal L2 learning outcomes. © 2020 Asociacion Mexicana de Maestros de Ingles MEXTESOL A.C.

The aim of this pilot study was to assess the impact and perceived value of an endodontic-themed escape game as assessed by fourth-year dental students. Methods: This study was conducted at the University of Nantes, Faculty of Dental Surgery using a cross-sectional pre- and post-test research design to assess students' changes in performance. Students in the fourth year of dental surgery study (n = 18) were divided in four groups for this study. The answers to the pre-test/post-test were 50 true/false questions. Moreover, a 20-question perception survey was given to all the participants after completion of the escape game. The study data were collected in May 2019. An unpaired t test analysed the mean differences between the groups. Results: The results showed a statistically significant increase in post-test results (75.33% ± 10.17% of correct answers) compared to the pre-test results (67.33% ± 5.94% of correct answers) P <.05. Analysis of variance revealed that this change in score was not significantly different between the four groups. The students perceived the endodontic-themed escape game to be relevant. A one-sample t test indicated that students' mean (SD) perception 4.4 (0.7) was statistically significantly higher than the mean value of the evaluation scale P <.001. The students found this educational game to be a useful experience that helped them recall/apply knowledge whilst promoting teamwork. Conclusion: Therefore, this type of game can enhance students' learning and motivation. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Findings: Based on the study findings, it is elucidated that playing video games has a positive impact on teenagers’ learning, and it promotes quick thinking. The participants exert effort to achieve goals, take up challenges for completing different points at various stages of games and interact with online competitors. It enhanced their social communication, problem-solving and IL (searching/locating and evaluating) skills. Research limitations/implications: The present study has some limitations. First, sample is limited to elite economic private schools of Lahore. Second, the lack of availability of regular video game players has limited the sample size, as Pakistan is a developing country and limited numbers of teenagers use and can afford gaming gadgets. Lastly, the results of this study are based on students’ perceptions, so there is a need to measure actual learning with assessments. Originality/value: The results of the study are beneficial for the game developers, teachers, librarians and parents. The education sector may support video games usability as learning tools. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Game based learning; Game literacy; Information literacy; Pakistan; Teenagers; Video games","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85076173746"

However, little is known about the assessment strategies that have a substantial contribution to the development of mathematical problem-solving skills in kindergarten children through to upper secondary school students. In this review of existing literature, we discuss the contribution of assessment strategies in the last three decades in strengthening learners’ acquisition of mathematical problem-solving skills. Twenty peer-reviewed conference papers and journal articles published from 1997 to 2020, downloaded from Google Scholar, Academia, and ERIC databases have been analyzed and discussed. Based on this review, it has been noted that the application of assessment strategies such as Structure of the Observed Learning Outcomes taxonomy, Higher-Order Thinking Skills model, performance assessments, authentic assessments, dynamic assessments, and video games-based assessments alongside the learner-centered/active learning methods like problem-based and cooperative learning is bound to strengthen students’ mathematical problem-solving skills. © 2021 by the authors; licensee Modestum.

With the growth of prevalent application areas such as 3D games, self-driving automobiles, health monitoring and sports activity training, a wide variety of new sensors have allowed researchers to develop feature description models beyond 2D. Although higher dimensional data enhance the performance of methods on numerous tasks, they can also introduce new challenges and problems. The higher dimensionality of the data often leads to more complicated structures which present additional problems in both extracting meaningful content and in adapting it for current machine learning algorithms.

Gamification is the use of game thinking and game mechanics in non-game contexts that support play to engage users in solving problems or created for teaching and learning purposes. Gamification does not mean creating games but making education more engaging and fun with play for learners, without undermining its credibility. In modern education, lessons delivery is associated with the lack of engagement and motivation of learners to participate actively in the learning process. Teachers are increasingly faced with the problem of how to integrate technology and to impart good language learning habits at the level of primary school in Malaysia.

Video games have incorporated AI and procedural generation for many years, but more recently, new applications of this technology have emerged in other media. Director Oscar Sharp and artist Ross Goodwin, for example, generated significant media buzz about two short films that they produced which were written by their AI screenwriter. It’s No Game (2017), in particular, offers an apt commentary on the possibility of replacing striking screenwriters with AI authors. Increasingly, AI agents and virtual assistants like Siri, Cortana, Alexa and Google Assistant are incorporated into our daily lives. As concerns about their eavesdropping circulate in news media, it is clear that these companions are learning a lot about us, which raises concerns about how our data might be employed in the future.

This article presents a review of the serious games found through a systematic literature review focused on the use of video games as tools for the prevention and detection of bullying and cyberbullying. With this review, we aim to determine: (1) the benefits of using video games as tools against bullying; (2) the mechanics and types of games used to address it; (3) the type of users on which they focus; (4) the type of studies and the number of users with which these games are evaluated; and (5) the availability of these tools, to determine to what degree society can benefit from their potential. The results show a wide variety of video games, using in turn very different strategies to deal with (cyber)bullying; and also that most of these games are not currently available. The different initiatives found confirm that serious games can be used effectively to raise awareness, create empathy, and teach new strategies to address both bullying and cyberbullying. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Games; Improving classroom teaching; Media in education; Teaching/learning strategies","Computer crime; Human computer interaction; Cyber bullying; Detection tools; Educational tools; Literature reviews; Mental health; Systematic literature review; Use of video; Video game; Serious games","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85087811858"

Researchers typically analyze such collaborative interactions among museumgoers through manual coding of live-or video-recorded exhibit use. We sought to determine how log data from an interactive multi-user exhibit could indicate patterns in visitor interactions that could shed light on informal collaborative learning. We characterized patterns from log data generated by an interactive tangible tabletop exhibit using factors like “pace of activity” and the timing of “success events.” Here we describe processes for parsing and visualizing log data and explore what these processes revealed about individual and group interactions with interactive museum exhibits. Using clustering techniques to categorize museumgoer behavior and heat maps to visualize patterns in the log data, we found distinct trends in how users solved the exhibit. Some players seemed more reflective, while others seemed more achievement oriented. We also found that the most productive sessions occurred when players occupied all four areas of the table, suggesting that the activity design had the desired outcome of promoting collaborative activity. © 2020, European Association for Research on Learning and Instruction.

Since traditional object detection techniques based on the shipborne radar are not qualified for the task of near and small ship detection, deep learning-based image recognition methods based on video surveillance systems can be naturally utilized on autonomous vessels to effectively detect near and small ships. However, a limited number of real-world samples of small ships may fail to train a learning method that can accurately detect small ships in most cases. To address this, a novel hybrid deep learning method that combines a modified Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based detection approach is proposed for small ship detection. Specifically, a Gaussian Mixture Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty is utilized to first directly generate sufficient informative artificial samples of small ships based on the zero-sum game between a generator and a discriminator, and then an improved CNN-based real-time detection method is trained on both the original and the generated data for accurate small ship detection. Experimental results show that the proposed deep learning method (a) is competent to generate sufficient informative small ship samples and (b) can obtain significantly improved and robust results of small ship detection. The results also indicate that the proposed method can be effectively applied to ensuring autonomous ship safety. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Autonomous ship; Convolutional neural network; Ship safety; Small ship detection; Wasserstein generative adversarial network","Convolutional neural networks; Image recognition; Learning systems; Object detection; Security systems; Ships; Unmanned surface vehicles; Adversarial networks; Artificial samples; Detection approach; Gaussian mixtures; Real-time detection; Recognition methods; Ship-borne radars; Video surveillance systems; article; convolutional neural network; deep learning; punishment; ship; Deep learning","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85086575601"

In this article, we report the results of a four-year study testing the extent to which a game-based learning approach to undergraduate engineering education demonstrating promising results in a university course was transportable to other engineering courses and universities. We evaluated students' conceptual understanding, emotional engagement (with the Experience Sampling Method), and experience when using the video game, Spumone, for their coursework compared to a textbook-based control condition. Multilevel models and other quantitative analyses showed that the effect of the experimental condition (i.e., game-based) on conceptual understanding and student engagement was not significant. Based on a content analysis of students' feedback, however, the students reported a positive experience with game-based learning for their assignments overall. Areas of need towards successful implementation of the game-based learning intervention were also examined.

This study created educational materials for learning about and teaching the human circulatory system based on augmented reality (AR) technology and a structure–behavior–function (SBF) model, including 2D/3D animations, a game, and a video to complement the current 2D representations in school textbooks. To evaluate the effectiveness of the materials developed, an instructional activity was carried out among fifty-one seventh- and eighth-grade students from a school in central Slovenia. A pretest, posttest, and delayed posttest for the instructional activity tested students’ knowledge, and their acceptance of the AR technology was explored through a questionnaire. The results showed significant improvements in students’ understanding of the basic anatomy and physiology of the human heart and circulatory system and the effects of adrenaline on the human circulatory system. Students expressed moderate enthusiasm for AR technology, showing the greatest level of acceptance of AR technology making learning more interesting and fun, improving learning, and making it easy to use. Although students showing more knowledge on the pretest expressed higher acceptance of AR technology, the gain in knowledge after an instructional activity was equally beneficial for all participants. The study indicates a beneficial effect of applying 3D animation, videos, and AR technology to understand dynamic and complex biological phenomena. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","2D/3D representations; Anatomy and physiology education; Attitudes; Augmented reality; Heart; Lower secondary school students; Structure–behavior–function model","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089562101"

Since user experience means holistic feelings caused by attributes like efficiency, effectiveness, pleasure, and attractiveness, it is necessary to evaluate user experience in many respects, including presence, usability, and workload. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the UX of VR in four various metrics: presence, workload, usability, and flow. In this study, the user experience factor was confirmed through the previous studies comparing visual display terminals (VDT) and head-mounted displays (HMD). In addition, the UX difference between VDT and HMD in two different situations, walking and driving, is analyzed. The data of 26 participants were analyzed and found that there were significant differences in the four studied metrics related to UX. In the driving situation, the usability value was higher in VDT, whereas they were higher in HMD for walking. Comparing the two contexts in HMD, walking was significantly higher in three metrics: presence, usability, and flow. The results show that HMD is better in terms of user experience than VDT, and HMD is more suitable for walking situations than for driving situations. Through this study, in terms of user experience, it is suitable to replace walking tasks with VR when the experiment in a real-world environment is impossible. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Driving simulation; Head-mounted display; Human walking; User experience; Virtual reality","Helmet mounted displays; Usability engineering; Virtual reality; Driving simulation; Driving situations; Evaluation of users; Head mounted displays; Human walking; Real world environments; User experiences (ux); Visual display terminals; adult; Article; car driving; controlled study; female; human; human experiment; male; normal human; priority journal; sex difference; video game; virtual reality; walking; workload; User experience","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089508798"

However, research to date has predominately examined such games in established democratic contexts and has primarily focused on the potential of in-game content and game mechanics for achieving learning and behavior change outcomes. This study used in-depth interviews with key developmental stakeholders for two civic-focused games, Haki2 in Kenya and Your Excellency in Nigeria, to further our understanding in two important but understudied areas: the potential for games to facilitate civic learning and engagement outcomes in developing democratic contexts; and the role of game production and dissemination processes in this potential. I argue that these processes provide opportunities for direct civic engagement, participatory learning, and group mobilization relevant to facilitating civic behavior in developing democratic contexts. While this research identifies critical limitations for games used as stand-alone tools to achieve civic learning and engagement outcomes, it also identifies the potential for game production and dissemination to engage communities in democratic deliberation, in identifying relevant civic-issues and solutions, to facilitate community discussion, and to mobilize players around relevant issues. © The Author(s) 2020.","civic engagement; civic learning; developing democracies; digital games; serious games; video games","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85083420444"

Using system-paced segments and decreasing the video’s presentation speed were tested as instructional strategies to reduce students’ cognitive load. The effectiveness of continuous versus segmented videos was explored in the first experiment. The second experiment compared the effectiveness of normal versus low levels of presentation speed. The results indicated that while the segmentation strategy has no significant effect on learning outcomes, students profited more from the low than the normal presentation speed, as evidenced by the more favourable relationship between mental effort investment and game performance.

As a collaborative and self-guided, inquiry-based learning method, it focuses on learners’ intrinsic motivation while working on real world problems organised in projects (Challenges in CBL) with an experiential and progressive approach to apply acquired knowledge in real world scenarios, ideate solution concepts and build innovative digital products. To overcome limitations of spiral curriculum or elaboration theory, the authors applied narrative theory to design the program’s educational experience for the academic year 2019/2020 as a cohesive journey within a communal learning environment with a coherent and connected structure of narratively driven learning Challenges. The authors present concepts to develop their approach further towards an emergent narrative experience design system to manage the educational journey as it develops, rather than scripting it. This paper evolves the authors’ Narrative Experience Design Canvas to model educational experience design that encourages unscripted, emergent narratives for experiential education with the goal of fostering learners’ engagement, agency and creativity. Derived in part by models developed for digital interactive storytelling or educational video games, it categorises the components for designing an educational experience that allows the learning progression to be driven by learners as co-authors and describes mechanisms that allow unscripted narratives to emerge based on intrinsic motivation. Additionally, the authors present considerations for synchronous and asynchronous learning to evolve their framework for application in blended or remote learning scenarios. Drawing upon findings for remote learning and experiential e-learning-ee-learning-presented by scholars as well as implications identified during the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting switch to remote learning within the program at University of Naples Federico II in 2020, it is shown how combining narrative elements with experiential e-learning principles can result in increased engagement, motivation and sense of community in learners. Using the example of an individual learning unit-a Challenge-considerations from overall course design down to day-to-day learning activities within the course are presented. For the future, the authors indicate action points to develop this model into an Emergent Narrative System for designing narratively driven and experiential software development education programs and indicate areas of further research on learning activity design for blended or remote learning experiences. © ACPIL.","Challenge based learning; Emergent narrative; Experiential e-learning; Learning experience design; Narrative theory; Remote learning","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85106611735"

This study contributes to research on the social context of learning by describing how children’s peer interactions can support or hinder the pair’s problem solving on the computer. Methods: Video recordings from eight pairs of middle school students programming a computer game are used to explore how working with a partner supports or hinders the pair’s persistence in the face of challenges, what we call intrepid exploration (IE). Findings: IE thrives when partners are responsive to each other both verbally and non-verbally, and when they switch driver and navigator roles to share and build on each other’s expertise. IE is hindered when partners engage in a power struggle that results in disengagement with each other and giving up on their goal. For pair programming to result in interactions that promote persistence, both students must be willing and able to embrace their assigned roles: the navigator supporting their shared goal, and the driver responding to their navigator. Contribution: The types of interactions described in this paper provide a tool for teachers to evaluate and support productive collaboration among novice pair programmers. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85108402356"

In three studies (data collected in the DC area: 12/2015–10/2017), children’s parasocial relationships and math talk with the intelligent character predicted quicker, more accurate math responses during virtual game play. Children performed better on a math transfer task with physical objects when exposed to an embodied character (Study 2), and when the character used socially contingent replies, which was mediated by math talk (Study 3). Results suggest that children’s parasocial relationships and parasocial interactions with intelligent characters provide new frontiers for 21st century learning. © 2019 Society for Research in Child Development","","Cartoons as Topic; Child; Child Development; Child, Preschool; Communication; Comprehension; Feasibility Studies; Female; Friends; Humans; Intelligence; Interpersonal Relations; Language Tests; Learning; Male; Mathematics; Object Attachment; Play and Playthings; User-Computer Interface; Video Games; Virtual Reality; article; child; female; human; learning; major clinical study; male; art; child development; comprehension; computer interface; education; feasibility study; friend; human relation; intelligence; interpersonal communication; language test; learning; mathematics; object relation; physiology; preschool child; psychology; recreation; video game; virtual reality","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85075332027"

The theoretical background of this study draws on various scholarships from video game research, constructivist learning theory, and the museum learning environment. This research was undertaken in two New Zealand museums (Te Papa in Wellington and Quake City in Christchurch) which housed the disaster video game Quake Safe House (QSH). The research findings and associated discussion considers the potential of QSH to build disaster awareness based upon participants' gameplay. Ultimately, it is demonstrated that the use of ‘serious’ disaster video games, such as QSH, cannot be a stand-alone item for the purpose of learning within a museum space. Instead, such video games require better integration within the museum's environment and educational disaster displays to encourage and foster the participation of museum visitors in learning about disaster and DRR through multiple mediums. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Beyond Stop Disasters 2.0 (BSD2.0); Constructivism; Disaster risk reduction (DRR); Museum; Quake Safe House; Video games","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85084793311"

Although prior GBL studies have highlighted the significance of learning engagement as a mediator of students’ meaningful learning, the existing accounts failed to capture specific evidence of how exactly students’ in-game actions in GBL enhance learning engagement. Hence, this mixed-method study was designed to examine whether middle school students’ in-game actions are likely to promote certain types of learning engagement (i.e., content and cognitive engagement). This study used and examined the game E-Rebuild, a single-player three-dimensional architecture game that requires learners’ application of math knowledge. Using in-depth gameplay behavior analysis, this study sampled a total of 92 screen-recorded and video-captured gameplay sessions attended by 25 middle school students. We adopted two analytic approaches: sequential analysis and thematic analysis. Whereas sequential analysis explored which in-game actions by students were likely to promote each type of learning engagement, the thematic analysis depicted how certain gameplay contexts contributed to students’ enhanced learning engagement. The study found that refugee allocation and material trading actions promoted students’ content engagement, whereas using in-game building tools and learning support boosted their cognitive engagement. This study also found that students’ learning engagement was associated with their development of mathematical thinking in a GBL context. © The Author(s) 2019.","game-based learning; learning engagement; sequential analysis; thematic analysis","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074027082"

In Vietnam, universities have used online learning to help learners keep learning in this pandemic context. However, students and teaching staff have expressed concerns about the quality of the learning process. Inthis context, our research is looking for solutions to apply new technology in the teaching process to ensure the quality and effectiveness of learning. Among these new technologies, we consider digital games because most students play digital games and their positive effects on teaching, as evidenced by recent publications. Under the approach of technological process, our team evaluated the feasibility and effectiveness of the digital game-based instructional technology at HUST. In terms of feasibility, research shows that most students agree that digital games can contribute to learning skills. In terms of effectiveness, there are three key findings. First, although male students play video games more than female students, the results show that both men and women have the same rate of digital games' effectiveness in learning. Second, there is no difference in assessing the effectiveness of digital games in learning between IT students and non-IT students although IT students are more exposed to technology. Third, there is a difference in the views of second-year students and third-year students. This difference illustrates the need for blended-learning courses that utilize digital games effectively for third-year engineering students who start more specialized engineering courses at universities © 2021, International Journal of Emerging Technologies in Learning.

Surprisingly little research has been done to explore the ways in which these devices support or not children's collaboration – instead research has focused on larger tabletop computers, or on collaboration around configurations of multiple tablet computers. In this paper we present a case-study analysis of pairs of children playing single player tablet games together. We use a combination of temporal video analysis and the Collaborative Learning Mechanisms (CLM) framework previously developed to understand collaboration around surfaces. This analysis aims to unpack collaborative interactions around these devices and identify ways in which successful and less successful collaborations occur. A comparison of our findings to previous studies of interactions around larger tabletop surfaces reveals some of the ways interactions around tablets differ to these. We use these understandings to begin to outline some of the issues to take into consideration when facilitating and designing for children's collaboration around single tablet computers. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","","Case study analysis; Collaborative interaction; Collaborative learning; Designing for children; Single users; Tablet computer; Temporal video; Engineering","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091077821"

An empirical study was conducted to test the predictive strength of some attributes of digital nativeness, as determined by Teo’s (2013) Digital Native Assessment Scale, on L2 vocabulary acquisition and on educational engagement. A vocabulary learning game was played by 86 university EFL students, who additionally completed post- and delayed knowledge tests on the vocabulary contained in the game, the DNAS questionnaire, and questions on educational disengagement and perceived need for technology-related changes. The regression analysis revealed that the factor “able to multitask” was a predictor of poorer L2 vocabulary acquisition, whereas the factors “comfortable with technology” and “thrive on instant gratifications and rewards” had a positive impact on learning outcomes. Additionally, the analysis showed that none of the attributes of digital natives that make up the DNAS could predict either students’ disengagement with the educational system or their perceived need for technology-based changes in education. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","digital game-based learning; Digital natives; language learning; video games; vocabulary acquisition","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85057560576"

Recent advancements in health care services demand reliable transmission of medical images and videos for better diagnosis and treatment. The effective utilization of available spectrum is one of the requirements for stable transmission of medical information. A Long Term Evolution (LTE) system model for a real-time multimedia application must provide high Quality of Service (QoS). Scheduling and allocating resources for real-time downlink flows in LTE networks is a challenging issue, as the network excellence and assured output have to be confirmed together with decreasing the Head of Line (HOL) suspension. The ever increasing demand for higher data rates in uplink and downlink transmission services constraints on delay and bandwidth requirements. This leads the existing fourth generation LTE wireless networks to concentrate more on the resource scheduling techniques with acceptable levels of Quality of Service (QoS).

Materials and Methods: An interactive computer module (Interactive Module to Halt Abuse of Prescriptions in Preteens and Youth [I'M HAPPY]) was created using a combination of e-learning and animation software. The module used narrated illustrations, animations, and games to explain what over-the-counter (OTC) and prescription drugs are, how they are used correctly, and what risks they carry. Animated drug refusal scenarios with user-determined outcomes were also incorporated. Sixth-grade students were asked to complete the module online and were given a 14-question pretest and posttest on the definitions, adverse effects, and proper use of OTC and prescription medicines. They were also asked to rank the perceived helpfulness of several drug refusal strategies. Student opinions about the computer module itself were collected on the posttest. Results: Students (n = 34) scored better on quiz questions following the module. They also showed increased favorability toward three of four drug refusal strategies after completing the module, with a greater proportion ranking these strategies ""Very Helpful.""Most students indicated they learned new things from the module (79%) and found it enjoyable (88%) and easy to use (97%).

Video games can be leveraged to develop self-directed learning in students because digital play environments are engaging and possess features conducive for independent learning, such as safe spaces and authentic learning environments. Our aim in this paper is to first derive a set of self-directed learning strategies in video games that can be adopted for use in pedagogical contexts. Second, the coding scheme of self-directed learning strategies can be used to evaluate video games for their suitability for developing self-directed learning strategies in students. User experience approaches such as interviews and the think-aloud protocol were used to analyse the gameplay videos of the study's participants for deriving the coding scheme of the self-directed learning strategies. Based on player experience, we also derived a set of factors that promoted self-directed learning in video games. These factors can be integrated by educators and user experience designers to improve video game design to foster the development of self-directed learning strategies in students. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Game-based learning; Interviews; Player experience; Self-directed learning; Think-aloud protocol","Computer aided instruction; Human computer interaction; Interactive computer graphics; Students; User experience; Video signal processing; Authentic learning environment; Independent learning; Learning models; Player experience; Self-directed learning; Teaching and learning; Technological advancement; Think-aloud protocol; Learning systems","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85084192239"

This study examined how modeling from both teacher education faculty and clinical educators influenced elementary education teacher candidates’ development of technology integration knowledge and use of technology while teaching. Further analysis looked at how technology modeling and use aligned to higher-order thinking skills using the Revised Bloom’s Taxonomy framework (Anderson & Krathwohl, 2000). Teacher education faculty primarily modeled technology integration with higher-order thinking skills such as rigorous practice activities and project-based learning, whereas the clinical educators modeled technology integration through lower-level activities such as educational review games and showing videos. Further, candidates used technology in lower-level ways more than higher-level ways.

However, gamified reading is new, and there is little empirical evidence regarding its effectiveness. The sustainability of the effects of gamification pedagogy is also in doubt as some scholars think that such effects are short-term and not sustainable. This paper presents the results of three sub-studies of examining the effects of an online gamified reading platform and the sustainability of these effects. Study 1 examined the change in students’ academic performance between two groups divided based on their different participation levels. Study 2 addressed the question of how students/parents/teachers perceive students’ motivation and gaining in the use of the gamified platform. Study 3 explored the sustainability of the effects of the gamified platform from a longitudinal perspective. Findings suggest that students’ deep engagement in the gamified e-learning platform can help increase their reading motivation and improve their reading abilities. Such effects can be sustained for several semesters. Practitioner Notes What is already known about this topic Reading is very important for children’s development. However, the ubiquity of digital entertainment (eg, digital games & online videos) occupies children’s attention and energy, resulting in a decline in children’s reading motivation. At present, gamification has been widely used in e-learning to increase learners’ learning motivation and engagement. Few studies have focused on children’s gamified reading supported by sufficient empirical evidence. What this paper adds This study proposes a gamification pedagogy with a gamified reading platform to facilitate primary students’ reading motivation and competence. This study uses a mixed-method approach to examine the effects of the proposed gamification pedagogy on students’ reading interest, motivation, habits and abilities. This study explores the sustainability of the gamified platform effects and fills the research gap regarding the sustainability of gamification pedagogy. Implications for practice and/or policy Active users of the gamified reading platform benefit from it in reading interest, motivation, habits, and abilities. The effects of gamification pedagogy can be sustainable when users’ intrinsic learning motivation is aroused. © 2020 British Educational Research Association","children’s reading; gamification; gamified learning; self-determination theory","E-learning; Motivation; Students; Sustainable development; Academic performance; Digital entertainment; Digital technologies; E-learning platforms; Learning motivation; Primary education; Reading abilities; Reading motivations; Gamification","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097490430"

During recent decades, much attention has been paid to video games and the multifarious ways in which they can promote and enhance learning. My main objective in this study is to weave game principles, learning and the notion of playfulness into assessment principles, in an attempt to investigate how what I call 'Game-Informed Playful Assessment' (GIPA) can affect student learning and particularly students' experience of learning. The GIPA was designed with a view to promoting students' agency, autonomy, collaboration and playfulness, and was introduced in an undergraduate course on archaic Greek lyric poetry at a Greek-speaking university. My data was generated through in-depth interviews with ten of the students that attended the course. While the GIPA was favourably and even enthusiastically received by students, the research also brought to the fore several other issues that call for attention, such as the stress that innovative assessment may provoke in students and the readiness of students to be playful within an academic framework that typically contrasts serious work with playfulness and play in general. © 2020 The Author(s).

This can lead to developing a feeling of detachment from the physical world, which, in turn, can lead to high levels of participation and engagement. Notwithstanding these results, it remains unclear as to whether students can experience the same kind of immersion in two-dimensional (2D) platform-based online collaborative learning spaces as has been achieved in video games and 3D worlds and, if they actually can, which features would lead to similar levels of increased engagement. This study is one of the first attempts to investigate the immersion experiences of students engaged in two 2D online collaborative learning platforms, one text-based and the other video-based. Data from eight students revealed that key features of immersion observed in video games and 3D worlds also appeared during the online collaborative activities but that the way such immersion was perceived by the students was greatly affected by the characteristics of the individual platform. When emotional engagement was considered, empathy was found to play an important role in the participants' immersion experiences. © 2021 Articles published in the Australasian Journal of Educational Technology (AJET).

RT assessment has traditionally focused on self-report questionnaires. These classical tools have shown clear distance from real-life responses. Behavioral tasks assess human behavior with more fidelity, but still show some limitations related to transferability. A way to overcome these constraints is to take advantage from virtual reality (VR), to recreate real-simulated situations that might arise from performance-based assessments, supporting RT research. This article presents results of a pilot study in which 41 individuals explored a gamified VR environment: the Spheres & Shield Maze Task (SSMT). By eliciting implicit behavioral measures, we found relationships between scores obtained in the SSMT and self-reported risk-related constructs, as engagement in risky behaviors and marijuana consumption. We conclude that decontextualized Virtual Reality Serious Games are appropriate to assess RT, since they could be used as a cross-disciplinary tool to assess individuals' capabilities under the stealth assessment paradigm.  © 2020 Carla de-Juan-Ripoll et al; Published by Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.","evaluation methodologies; implicit measures; risk taking; serious games; virtual reality","Adult; Behavior Observation Techniques; Computer Simulation; Decision Making; Female; Humans; Male; Maze Learning; Pilot Projects; Risk-Taking; Video Games; Virtual Reality; adult; behavioral observation; computer simulation; decision making; female; high risk behavior; human; male; maze test; pilot study; procedures; psychology; video game; virtual reality","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85096152129"

To empower 'Millennial' learners to take control of their own learning, a single-player, unguided web-based Neonatal Resuscitation Game was designed. The present study investigates the effectiveness of the game on retention of resuscitation knowledge and skills. Methods: The study evaluated 162 healthcare professionals who attended simulation-based training in neonatal resuscitation. Following standard simulation-based training, participants were assigned to either a gaming group (Gamers) with access to the web-based Neonatal Resuscitation Game or a control group (Controls) with no access to the game. Although Gamers were given access, game utilization was completely voluntary and at will. Some Gamers chose to utilize the web-based game (Players) and others did not (Non-players). Knowledge and skills in neonatal resuscitation were assessed upon completion of training and 6 months post-training using a multiple-choice question test and a manikin-based skills test. Changes in scores were compared statistically between Gamers vs Controls, Players vs Controls, and Players vs Controls + Non-players using two-sample t-tests. Results: At the final assessment, declines in knowledge scores were seen in all groups. Mean change from baseline in knowledge and skill performance scores at 6 months, adjusted for baseline skill performance and MCQ test scores, did not differ significantly between Players vs Controls and Players vs Controls + Non-players. Conclusion: The web-based game in its current format may not be effective in facilitating retention of knowledge and technical skills in neonatal resuscitation. © 2020 The Author(s).","Digital games; Healthcare education; Memory and retention; Neonates; Newborn infants; Resuscitation; Serious games; Technology-enhanced training or learning","Adult; Aged; Allied Health Personnel; Clinical Competence; Computer-Assisted Instruction; Education, Medical, Continuing; Education, Nursing, Continuing; Educational Measurement; Female; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Male; Middle Aged; Resuscitation; Simulation Training; Video Games; Young Adult; adult; aged; clinical competence; education; female; human; male; medical education; middle aged; newborn; nursing education; paramedical personnel; procedures; resuscitation; simulation training; teaching; video game; young adult","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85085539303"

As mental health can strongly influence academic performance, addressing the loss of community by transitioning to distance education, midsemester, is imperative. This work draws upon the community and wellness benefits associated with online gaming and applies it to ChemDraw. The goal is to improve the class' wellness and social community while teaching valuable organic chemistry skills. In this paper, a molecule, speed-drawing tournament (Molecule Madness) is presented along with reflections describing the impacts on student wellness and organic chemistry skills. Gamification of ChemDraw is achieved by (1) treating at-home practice as video-game training and (2) using video-conferencing software as a medium for multiplayer gameplay. As the primary focus is placed on education rather than entertainment, ChemDraw is subclassified as a serious educational game. Community is developed by in-game, online chat: observers, announcers, and competitors all interact with each other in real time. The tournament provided students an event to look forward to, helped maintain/improve class community, and developed organic chemistry skills (molecular drawing, history of molecules, and conversational IUPAC) in addition to increased appreciation for IUPAC nomenclature. Although an online community cannot substitute for in-person classroom experiences, this activity supplements the loss of community associated with social distancing and could be extended to enhance community within a face-To-face environment. Additionally, ideas are presented that illustrate how other chemistry classes and topics can be gamified in computer environments (both single-and multiplayer) by drawing upon well-established gaming modes (story mode, maker mode, and speed runs). Overall, this work highlights the supplemental role that chemistry video games can play in learning chemistry: by engaging students in an alternative, yet familiar to many format, classroom community and student confidence are maintained/strengthened.

This research used a case study design to which data were analyzed using a qualitative approach. The sample for the study comprised students who were learning social and political sciences at the Universitas Tulungagung. The researcher applied various instruments to collect this data, namely a document review, a test, and a questionnaire. To collect data, the teacher asked the students to compile a video where they talk about the culture they grew up in, such as traditional games, dances, or other elements of cultural heritage. The research was guided by checking documentation for student's achievement in spoken English, interviewing the students, and administering a test to measure the students' speaking ability shortly after compiling their videos. Results show that the mean score for the speaking test was higher after applying PBL than the score in the documentation, which predated the PBL. Results of questionnaire revealed that 90% of the students said they ""agree"" or ""strongly agree"" that creating a video where they talk about their culture made learning easier and more attractive, because it is more authentic. © 2020 Asian EFL Journal Press.

As other basic engineering subjects, it needs an active participation of the students in the learning process. However, nowadays, one of the main difficult to teach this kind of disciplines is to keep the student's motivation and participation in the learning process. For this reason, the use of new tools, as the educational gamification, can help to change the way to understand and teach this subject (Ballesteros et al., 2019). In this context, the application of game-based activities to engineering education has increased in popularity among students (Blumenfeld et al., 1991). In this work, we present the application of a escape room-based to heat transfer interactive evaluation for third year chemical engineering students. The plot of our escape lab-room is focused on a crazy scientific (Dr. Nusselito Graetzoff) that is obsessed with the heat transfer. He has retained a group of scientists and has the code for a missile launch. It is a national security case! The students (distributed by groups) play the role of heat transfer specialists from different Research Centers, which have to complete two missions: release the imprisoned scientists, and avoid the missile launch planned by Dr. Nusselito. Therefore, the students have to solve different questions/cases related to heat transfer issues, obtaining the codes that will allow them to complete their mission. The plot of the activity is conducted by using videos, in which the different parts of the activity are described. In addition, the professors supervise and help the correct progress of the escape room. We used the same kind of theoretical and applied problems in both evaluation methods, traditional exam and escape room one. After this experience, we can confirm the increase of student participation regarding to previous years. In addition, the students showed enthusiastic attitude (Fig. 1a) and a high satisfaction level. Therefore, the students’ participation of escape lab-room, to heat transfer teaching was completely successful, although this activity only accounts for a 10 % of the total course score. © 2020 Institution of Chemical Engineers","(6 maximum) escape room; Active learning; Cooperative learning; Gamification; Heat transfer; Student-centered learning","Heat transfer; Learning systems; Missile launching systems; Missiles; National security; Chemical engineering students; Engineering degrees; Evaluation methods; Learning process; Missile launches; Previous year; Research center; Student participation; Students","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85087744323"

As VR devices improve and become more widely available, there remains a number of unanswered questions regarding the impact of VR on student learning and how best to use this technology in the classroom. On the topic of electrostatics, for example, a large, controlled, randomized study performed by Smith et al. [A controlled study of stereoscopic virtual reality in freshman electrostatics, Proceedings of the 2017 Physics Education Research Conference, Cincinnati, OH, PER Conference series (2017), pp. 376-37910.1119/perc.2017.pr.089], found that VR-based instruction had an overall negligible impact on student learning compared to videos or images. However, they did find a strong trend for students who reported frequent video game play to learn better from VR than other media. One possible interpretation of this result is that extended videogame play provides a kind of ""training""that enables a student to learn more comfortably in the virtual environment. In the present work we consider if a VR training activity that is unrelated to electrostatics can help prepare students to learn electrostatics from subsequent VR instruction. We find that preliminary VR training leads to a small but statistically significant improvement in student performance on our electrostatics assessment. We also find that student reported game play is still correlated with higher scores on this metric © 2020 authors.","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092018570"

Materials and Methods: Students participated in three sessions organised as FC, implemented either as conventional FC or FC augmented with the GoDental! game. In the pre-class phase, sessions 1 and 2 were organised as instructor-made video lectures, plus a questionnaire. These activities were supplemented with the individual development of questions and answers for the game in session 3. In the in-class phase, group and plenary discussions were used during sessions 1 and 2 and were replaced by game activities in session 3. Perceptions of session 3 compared to that of sessions 1 and 2 were explored via a questionnaire with both open-ended and Likert-scale items. Results: Most students (29, 97%) perceived the FC session augmented with the GoDental! game as enjoyable. The game augmented session was perceived as more enjoyable compared to the conventional FC sessions. Students agreed that GBL augmented FC compared to conventional FC increased engagement (25, 83%), motivation (24, 83%), their integration in the social environment (23, 77%) and concentration (22, 73%), helped them learn more about the topic (24, 80%) and was a good learning method (25, 83%). There was a positive correlation between the degree of enjoyment and concentration and the feeling that the game helped them learn more about the topic. Conclusion: Game-based learning augmented FC proved to enhance students’ experience, resulting in increased enjoyment compared to the conventional FC setup. Future studies should explore whether the use of GBL in FC has the potential to increase examination performance. © 2020 The Authors.

The revival of board gameplay has been discussed in mainstream media, and has drawn the attention of researchers. Yet, in the field of games studies, the conception of games as learning spaces is mostly emphasized through digital/video games. Aim: This literature review reveals the current knowledge regarding the learning potential of board games in various settings, subjects, and diverse learners. Results: Board games are spaces for mathematical learning and learning spaces that can enable the learning of various contents. Board games allow for various interactions that result in players engaging in computational thinking, teamwork, and creativity. Conclusion: The relationship between board gameplay and learning is evidenced across disciplines and countries. Board games simplify complex issues and systems, which make them appropriate to further explore learning and concepts such as motivation and computational thinking in formal and informal settings. Furthermore, there is need to expand research on learning in commercial board games. © The Author(s) 2020.","board games; diversity; game studies; learning; literature review; objective","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85083514775"

Although playing video games can be an effective learning method, we do not know its impact on the reasoning ability of students with different cognitive styles. The purposes of this study are to investigate whether students with different cognitive styles improve their reasoning ability after playing video games and whether the effect is the same for all students. We used a pretest-posttest experimental design with multivariant analyses and found that elementary school students’ reasoning ability improved reliably after playing a puzzle adventure game for four weeks, twice a week. In addition, field-independent students’ reasoning ability improved reliably more than field-dependent students did. Students with different cognitive styles also demonstrated noticeably different information search strategies during game playing. Our work answers the questions regarding the impact of playing video games in students’ reasoning ability and in students with different cognitive styles. We also suggested guidelines of designing educational video games for field-dependent and field-independent students. Future studies are needed to expand our understanding to the relationships between other types of video game, cognitive ability, and cognitive styles. © 2021.

With technologies being more applied in science education for enhancing learning engagement, it is important to study how learning environments with different levels of technological engagement (LTEs) affect students’ learning. Data were collected from 168 fourth-grade students, ages 9–10, divided into 3 groups of different learning environments: (1) game-based instruction (high LTE) and (2) video-based instruction (medium LTE) as the two experimental groups, and (3) traditional instruction (low LTE) as the control group. Students’ learning was monitored with two tests: scientific concept test and the scientific argumentation skills test. Descriptive and inferential statistics including t-test, ANCOVA, and the Johnson-Neyman procedure were used to examine how different LTEs affect students’ learning as a group and by level (high-, medium-, and low-achieving). Findings demonstrated that (a) three forms of technology-supported learning significantly improve students’ scientific knowledge and argumentation skills; (b) higher LTEs lead to significantly better learning of scientific knowledge, except for some high-achieving students who can learn equally well in traditional instruction; and (c) higher LTEs lead to significantly better learning of argumentation skills across all students. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","engagement; game-based instruction; Learning environment; science learning; video-based instruction","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85067584175"

Less prominence has been given to the community benefits that STEM education can bring and even less attention has been given to the potential for children’s learning of STEM to increase adults’ understanding of environmental issues.Purpose: This study examined how an interdisciplinary STEM education unit of work was implemented in a primary school to educate children’s families and the school community about a little known but significant issue: the plight of honey bees.Sample: The paper reports on two primary school teachers and their classes who were engaging in a STEM unit of work. The children were aged nine and ten years old and the school was in a metropolitan location. The unit of work being taught focussed on creating an education game to highlight the importance of honey bees.Design and methods: Using a case study design multiple sources of data were collected including video, semi structured interviews, and work samples over the course of eight lessons. The data analysis involved an iterative model of video analysis integrated with analysis of student games and community interviews. Results: The multiple sources of data suggested that the extended learning module was able to support the development of student understanding of the plight of honey bees and that children were able to transform their learning into board games that enabled the children to inform and inspire the local community. Conclusion: These findings offer insights into how children can transform their learning into a resource and then can use this resource to educate a school community about a complex and significant environmental issue. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","classroom research; primary pedagogy; STEM education; video","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074863761"

Method: A Pilot Study (N = 44) assessed visual transfer effects in a two-group pre-post design. The Main Study (N = 151) employed a 2 (visual games: yes, no) × 2 (auditory games: yes, no) × 3 (test session: pretest, post-test, follow-up) design, allowing different training groups to act as active controls for each other. Neuropsychological test scores were aggregated into verbal-memory (auditory presentation), visual-processing, working-memory, and processing-speed indexes. Results: Visual-processing and working-memory pre-post-training change scores were differentially modulated across the four gameplay groups in the main sample, demonstrating transfer effects differing across both active- and passive-control groups. Visual training yielded modality-specific transfer effects in both samples, transfer to working memory in the main sample, and transfer to processing speed in the pilot sample. There were no comparable transfer effects for auditory training. Combined-visual-and-auditory training failed to yield synergistic effects or any significant transfer effects. Visual-processing transfer effects remained significant at follow-up. Discussion: Visual and auditory games differentially modulated transfer effects. Domain-specific visual transfer effects were found at post-test and were durable at follow-up. Visual gameplay holds potential to ameliorate age-related cognitive decline in visual cognition. © The Author(s) 2019.

While some had experience in planning flipped or blended lessons, switching to 100% online instruction was unfamiliar. Many educators faced the problems of too many resources to sift through and too little time to master them before beginning online instruction. While numerous technology tools are available for use during remote learning, this communication focuses on the applications commonly used and vetted by teachers in Maine Township High School District 207. The resources introduced and described in this paper include applications for communication, creation of interactive videos, applications of games for the classroom, computer simulations, online assessments, and opportunities for student voice and choice. Further details and online support to learn these applications are noted. These technological tools are also useful during flipped or blended lessons. The applications are discussed as they are implemented during specific stages of the 5E instructional model, which includes these five phases: Engage, Explore, Explain, Elaborate, and Evaluate.

Literature indicates that video games in general have entertaining, motivational, and educational benefits. Despite this, there is a lack of research comparing game types to assess their value for learning. Typically, DGBL approach may include a variety of game types, like those designed for educational purposes such as digital education games (DEGs), as well as those created for entertainment and commercial reasons, such as massively multiplayer online games (MMOs). Digital games do possess a significantly high capacity to keep users engaged, which is a potential that can be used to motivate learners to interact more deeply with their learning environments, and consequently enhance their performances. This study supports the hypothesis that both DEGs and MMOs can be instrumental in improving engagement and learning versus traditional teaching methods. The article shares the results of the mixed methods study that examined the use of one DEG and four MMOs in undergraduate courses within a community college. The results suggest that learner performance and engagement are enhanced when using DGBL for both types of games, versus the traditional teaching methods. Additionally, practitioner and future research implications are also discussed. © 2020, IGI Global.

These include visual-spatial awareness, rapid decision making, and psychomotor skills. The role of video game cross-training on learning bronchoscopy is unknown. Objective: We studied the association of baseline video gaming experience with, and the impact of short-term video game playing on, visual-spatial awareness and acquisition of basic bronchoscopic skills among medical trainees. Methods: Bronchoscopy-naive medical trainees underwent formal didactic and handson instruction on basic bronchoscopy, along with a baseline assessment measuring bronchoscopic and visual-spatial skills. Half of the subjects were subsequently randomized to playing a videogame (Rocket League) for 8 weeks. All participants returned at 4 weeks for a refresher course and at 8 weeks for a final assessment. Results: Thirty subjects completed the study, 16 of themin the intervention armwho allmet the minimum video game playing time requirement. At baseline, video game players had significantly lower airway collision rates (6.82 collisions/min vs. 11.64 collisions/min; P= 0.02) and higher scores on the Purdue Visual Spatial Test: Visualization of Rotations test (27.5 vs. 23.54; P= 0.04). At completion, the intervention group had no significant differences in airway collisions, bronchoscopy time, or Bronchoscopy Skills and Tasks Assessment Tool scores. There was moderate correlation between airway collision rate and mean Purdue Visual Spatial Test: Visualization of Rotations score (Spearman's rho, -0.59; P<0.001). Conclusion: At baseline, learners with former video game-playing experience have higher visual-spatial awareness and fewer airway collisions. The impact of video game playing as an aid to simulation-based bronchoscopic education is uncertain. © 2020 by the American Thoracic Society.","bronchoscopy; simulation; Video game","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85098880582"

The sample of 100 children (mean age 13.37) was taken, and children were asked to fill in a diary when they played videogames for a week. The results revealed the time spent playing violent video games (role play, action and fighting, and first-person shooter) was positively correlated with aggression; however, only role play and first-person shooter video games were positive predictors of aggressive behaviour.

As a result of data analysis, ""identifying the targets of attacks"" emerges as a core concept on the phenomenon of learning IHL through video games in addition to eight sub-concepts encircling this core concept. Sorting out the relevance among these concepts, the present study discovers six patterns to explicate the phenomenon, which are as follows: (A) smooth IHL learning with the use of knowledge already acquired; (B) committing illegal acts as virtual reality; (C) disregarding the instructors' lectures and committing illegal acts; (D) learning IHL norms on the basis of lectures by the instructors; (E) discovery of IHL norms during gameplay; and (F) trajectory modification from illegal acts. By intercomparing these six patterns, the author isolated four distinct operations that are central to IHL application learning through war games, which include 1) paying attention to lectures by the instructors; 2) working on elements for identifying the targets of attacks; 3) imagining real fighting conditions and feeling empathy for real combatants; and 4) paying attention to admonitions after illegal acts. Accordingly, so as to achieve further improvement of the effect of IHL learning through war video games, it can be contended that adopting contrivances that enable players to pass through these four operations is extremely important. © 2020 Cornell Law School.

With teachers increasingly bringing video games into schools for the purposes of engagement and learning, there is a need to better understand how young people’s dispositions (Bourdieu, 1990) enable them to navigate the space between real and virtual identities within a formal learning environment. A qualitative case-study project was conducted, involving the introduction of video games into a high-school classroom, guided by the research question: what are the possibilities for projective identity work in the games-as-text English classroom? The study found that three factors--student habitus, game design, and classroom pedagogy--impacted how students realised the relationship between virtual and real-world identities. These findings have implications for those introducing games into classrooms as objects of study, seeking to enhance engagement and learning. © 2020, Game Studies.

AIMS: The purposes of this research were to design a VR game and to apply it to teach physiotherapy in neurological diseases. METHODOLOGY: In this study, at first, a VR game was designed for upper limb rehabilitation in brain-injured patients based on the literature and the opinions of physiotherapy experts and game designers. Then, the designed game was used for teaching physiotherapy in neurological diseases. Thereafter, the opinions of 31 undergraduate students about the teaching session were evaluated by two anonymous questionnaires. Data analysis was performed using descriptive statistics through SPSS (version 19). RESULTS: The VR game developed under expert supervision. The evaluation showed that the median score for students' perception of learning was 3.11. The median scores of questions related to the 'facilitating level of virtual reality' and 'student satisfaction' were 8.66 and 9, respectively. The analysis of students' responses to open-ended questions highlighted the therapeutic aspect of the game compared to its educational aspect. CONCLUSIONS: Application of VR games in education can enhance the students' perception of learning. Furthermore, it can provide a better understanding of physiotherapy in patients with neurological diseases as well as the satisfaction of students. However, the survey indicated that the good results of this teaching method are due to the use of VR for guiding the patient's movements. © 2020 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

Technology enhanced and team training methodologies are in vogue though well studied in the nursing profession, teaching avenues for junior ‘doctors in training’ seem to be a lacuna. Aims: The BEME systematic review was designed to (1) appraise the existing published evidence on educational interventions that are intended for ‘doctors in training’ to teach early recognition and prompt escalation in acute clinical deteriorations (2) to synthesise evidence & to evaluate educational effectiveness. Methodology: The method applied was a descriptive, justification & clarification review. Databases searched included PubMed, PsycINFO, Science Direct and Scopus for original research and grey literature with no restrictions to year or language. Abstract review, full text decisions and data extraction were completed by two primary coders with final consensus by a third reviewer. Results: 5592 titles and abstracts were chosen after removal of 905 duplications. After exclusion of 5555 studies, 37 full text articles were chosen for coding. 22 studies met final criteria of educational effectiveness, relevance to acute care. Educational platforms varied from didactics to blended learning approaches, small group teaching sessions, simulations, live & cadaveric tissue training, virtual environments and insitu team-based training. Translational outcomes with reduction in long term (up to 3–6 years) morbidity & mortality with financial savings were reported by 18% (4/22) studies. Interprofessional training were reported in 41% (9/22) of studies. Recent evidence demonstrated effectiveness of virtual environment and mobile game-based learning. Conclusions: There were significant improvements in teaching initiatives with focus on observable behaviours and translational real patient outcomes. Serious game-based learning and virtual multi-user collaborative environments might enhance individual learners’ cognitive deliberate practice. Acute care learning continuum with programmatic acute care portfolios could be a promise of the future. © 2020 AMEE.","acute deteriorations; acute/critical care; health professions education; medical education; teaching effectiveness; Teaching interventions; teaching methods; trainee doctors (junior and senior house officers); undergraduate and postgraduate training","Clinical Competence; Clinical Deterioration; Critical Care; Education, Medical; Faculty, Medical; Humans; Internship and Residency; Mobile Applications; Students, Medical; Teaching; Video Games; adult; comparative effectiveness; consensus; data extraction; deterioration; emergency care; female; grey literature; human; human experiment; intensive care; language; learning; male; medical student; Medline; morbidity; mortality; occupation; postgraduate education; PsycINFO; resident; review; ScienceDirect; Scopus; simulation; systematic review; clinical competence; intensive care; medical education; medical school; medical student; mobile application; psychology; teaching; video game","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85086882057"

Individual interaction with digital devices in infancy and early childhood posits both benefits and risks in gaining informal learning experiences. The lack of relevant studies on the issue brings forward the aim of the research, which is to explore digital devices use for learning in infancy and early childhood as parents report it. 93 parents of 113 children aged 0–8 years old participated in an online survey to find out peculiarities of the children using digital devices for learning, frequency of using them, and parents’ mediation in this process. For each aspect, Cramér’s V and Somers’ D were employed to make statistical differences between three age groups: 0–3, 4–5, 6–8 years old. The findings showed that the number of children using digital devices for learning increased with their age. Devices with the touch screen were especially popular for viewing videos, self-development, and gaming. The parents restricted content and learning time of their children using digital devices, which still required careful regulation and control. It is recommended that parents select learning applications and games appropriate for their children’s age since digital devices impact on the children’s health and development. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Digital natives; Digital technologies; Google forms; Informal learning settings; Learning habits","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85082015952"

In node-based movement systems, players navigate by jumping to set locations. Node-based movement is similar to hypertext navigation. We show that the hypertext lostness measure can be used as a game analytic to evaluate navigational efficiency. In a randomized controlled trial with 25 adolescent participants, an immersive desktop game environment and a VR game environment were compared on the transmission of in-game educational content and navigational efficiency. Results show that the hypertext lostness measure is also valuable outside its original hypertext domain: in VR. VR did not improve players' retention of factual knowledge, but did significantly improve players' spatial knowledge and navigational efficiency. We conclude (a) the hypertext lostness measure is also valuable for node-based VR games and (b) VR games add to spatial learning, even when compared with already immersive desktop games.  © Copyright 2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2020.","knowledge; learning; lostness; navigation; serious games; virtual reality (VR)","Adolescent; Female; Humans; Hypermedia; Knowledge; Male; Spatial Learning; Video Games; Virtual Reality; adolescent; controlled study; female; human; hypermedia; knowledge; male; psychology; randomized controlled trial; spatial learning; video game; virtual reality","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85090898050"

A systematic review identified 15 DGBL systems that report effects from their use of narratives. A gap in the field, however, is the lack of a common model to categorize and isolate narratives in DGBL to enable an analysis and comparison of how, and under what conditions, narratives have effects on learning in DGBL systems. The ludo narrative variable model (LNVM) that has been used to isolate and categorize narratives in research on commercial video games is a candidate to fill this gap. This research has investigated the potential of this model for DGBL and resulted in an extended LNVM (eLNVM) that can be used to isolate and categorize narratives in DGBL. The 15 DGBL systems were categorized on the eLNVM and the results show that there are characteristics of DGBL systems with positive self-reported effects that separate them from other DGBL systems. Furthermore, it was possible to identify characteristics of the narrative modeling that are associated with positive effects on engagement, motivation and learning. The paper concludes with a description of how the eLNVM will be used in future research. © 2020 The Authors.

This study aims to seek the influences of hybrid learning with video conference and chemistry on android game (chemondro-game) on students’ self-efficacy, self-regulated learning, and achievement toward chemistry of hydrocarbon topics. Through quasi-experiment with post-test only design, 143 eleventh grade students were selected as the research sample of the study and they were drawn from two secondary schools in Central Java, Indonesia. The sample of the study was composed of three classes based on each group's exposure to different teaching interventions. Experimental Class (EC) received hybrid learning with video conference and chemondro-game, Compared Class-1 (CC-1) was exposed to hybrid learning with video conference only, and Compared Class-2 (CC-2) treated by face-to-face learning with chemondro-game only. The students’ self-efficacy, self-regulated learning, and achievement data were obtained using Scale of Self-Efficacy (SSE), Scale of Self-Regulated Learning (SSRL), and the Test on Chemistry Hydrocarbon (TCH), respectively. In addition, an Observation Sheet on Self-Regulated Learning (OSSRL) was prepared to observe students’ activities during the learning process. MANOVA technique and descriptive statistics were performed to examine the influences of teaching intervention on students’ self-efficacy, self-regulated learning, and achievement in this instructional model. The findings revealed that the teaching intervention has significant influences on students’ self-efficacy and self-regulated learning, however no significant influence on students’ achievement. Thus, the use of video conference and chemondro-game are strongly suggested in chemistry learning due to its potential to develop self-efficacy and self-regulated learning of the students. ©ISSN:1304-6020","Chemistry on android game; hybrid learning; self-efficacy; self-regulated learning; video conference","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85109429846"

The authors developed a psychiatric adaptation of the « Hat Game ». It was hypothesised that this game would increase both knowledge and motivation in medical students toward psychiatric semiology. The aim of the study was to assess the benefit of a Psychiatric Hat Game session for learning psychiatric symptoms in third-year medical students. Student performance was also evaluated at 3 months. Methods: This gamified fast-track training consists of two teams and each team has to guess as many psychiatric semiology terms as possible using different techniques (i.e. speech, mime). The study involved a pre- and post-evaluation of knowledge (Multiple Choice Questions) and a satisfaction survey. Baseline, post-immediate, and three-months scores were compared by using Friedman analysis for paired samples. Comparisons of mean scores at two different times were performed by using Wilcoxon test for paired samples. Results: One hundred and sixty-six students were proposed to take part in the study. Among them 129 completed the whole program (response rate = 77.7%). Mean scores measured at the three points in time were significantly different (p < 0.001, N = 129). Knowledge mean scores were significantly higher after the game than before (+ 28.6%, p < 0.001). Improvement was maintained 3 months after the game (+ 18.9%, p < 0.001). Satisfaction survey items highlighted that students enjoyed and would recommend this type of gamified training. Conclusions: The Psychiatric Hat Game improved knowledge of psychiatric semiology in medical students. Results suggest that it is a promising and efficient tool to playfully teach medical semiology, with transferable features, utility and acceptability from one medical field to another. This study contributes to the growing body of knowledge advocating for serious games and gamified training in medical education. © 2020, The Author(s).","Gamified training; Hat game; Learning; Medical education; Memorization","Education, Medical, Undergraduate; Humans; Prospective Studies; Psychiatry; Students, Medical; Video Games; human; medical education; medical student; prospective study; psychiatry; video game","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092769943"

However, there is an important factor that is not usually considered in the design of serious games— the inclusion of people with disabilities. Inclusion can be reached only if accessibility takes on an important role for all. On the other hand, new trends have resulted in different smart devices being used in classrooms. These devices also allow for applications, such as serious games, to be used to support people’s learning process. Despite this, these applications are generally not multi-platform and do not usually consider accessibility features for people with disabilities. This paper proposes a method to develop accessible online serious games that consider people with disabilities as potential users. The method is applied in the case study of an online serious game that teaches about the architecture of a computer in a fun and entertaining way. The method also presents and describes several guidelines to improve online serious game accessibility for people with disabilities. Finally, tests are conducted with some users to gather information about the online serious game and the accessibility features included. This study has important implications for the development of learning tools that consider people with disabilities. © 2020 by the authors.

The instructional tool was an educational video game designed to teach a personal finance lesson on credit scores through individual play. The research questions focused on differences in participant performance, engagement, and attitude. The participants in the study consisted of adults from traditional extension and outreach audiences associated with a land-grant university located in the intermountain western United States. The results of this study indicated that, with one exception, there were no significant differences in outcomes between the four different methods of instruction. The broad interpretations of this study are that educational outcomes of using educational video games may not vary greatly based on social context when using precise definitions of competition and cooperation. Importantly, this affords educators the general freedom to choose among a number of social educational structures without fear of significantly compromising educational outcomes. © The Author(s) 2020.","competition; Cooperation; education; personal finance; transformational play; video game","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089684054"

Educational tools that fit the specific learning styles of nurses and nursing students might be useful for this. Serioussoap.nl (available in Dutch and English) is an educational tool that integrates video-based gaming and storytelling, and it might be an effective way to improve the geriatric knowledge of nurses or nursing students. Objectives: To investigate the effect of Serioussoap.nl on the geriatric knowledge of nurses and nursing students, and to evaluate its usability. Design: We conducted a development and an explorative pilot study, using a pretest posttest quantitative design to investigate the effect of Serioussoap.nl on geriatric knowledge. A qualitative approach was used to evaluate its usability. Participants and setting: Three vocational nursing schools (n = 119 second/third year students), one baccalaureate nursing university (n = 77 first year vocational nurses) and one home-care organization (n = 44 vocational nurses) in the Netherlands participated in the quantitative study, and 94 vocational students participated in the qualitative study. Methods: We measured the effect on geriatric knowledge with the Knowledge of Older People Questionnaire (KOP-Q, score 0–30). The qualitative study included observations of 94 participants while they played Serioussoap.nl, four semi-structured focus groups and eleven individual interviews. Results: The study demonstrated a significant increase of geriatric knowledge of 7.8% (+2.3 score on the KOP-Q, 95% Confidence Interval (1.4–3.2, p < 0.001). The qualitative data showed that Serioussoap.nl contributed to the reflective learning-style and enhanced meaningful learning. Conclusion: Serioussoap.nl increased the students' geriatric knowledge and was perceived as a suitable and effective educational tool for vocational nursing students and nurses. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Geriatric nursing education; Interactive video.

While the justification for these moves is often the improvement of outcomes for young children, they ignore the large body of research that attests to the social, emotional, and academic benefits of children having time to play and to experience educational programs founded in play-based pedagogies. Focus of the study: In this study, we were interested in considering how young children name their worlds in education contexts in which literacies and sustainability education are brought together as educational concepts. This paper reports on the playing of one game over time and considers the opportunities that were created by the playing of the game and the competence of the young children in using the game to collaborate, to learn literacy, and to make spaces for other everyday business together. Setting: The fieldwork which produced the data for this paper involved two researchers attending a suburban Australian early-childhood education context regularly for one year. Participants: The children and educators of the center were engaged in an approved program, in the year before school starts within Australian requirements. Therefore the children ranged in age from 3 to 5 years. Research design: This paper reports on a qualitative study of one class of young children and their educators. Data were collected during fieldwork visits over a period of one year. We observed the children's engagement in outdoor play, collecting data in the form of short video recordings, still images, field notes, and texts produced by the children. Conclusions: Our analysis provides evidence that children can demonstrate competent understandings of how language, bodies, movement, and space position themselves and others. The children involved competently collaborated and used language and texts to get along and to sustain a game over many months. They were only able to achieve this because they were given space to play, to own and govern spaces of play, and to problem-solve together as issues arose. The opportunity to direct themselves and their friends was vital as they developed respectful language and literacy practices. © 2021 Teachers College, Columbia University.

In particular, this study revealed the video game genres, characters, and in-game elements and features that Gen Zers find attractive both in general and by gender. Our study also explored the genres, characters, in-game elements, and features that Gen Zers miss and are looking for in future games. Understanding the preferences of Gen Z players allows game designers, especially designers of educational and serious games dealing with current global and social issues, to make inferences about the Generation Z's preferred game features and thus better personalise gameplay. Our findings also confirmed that video games are both fun and educational: Our respondents indicated that they learned and reinforced knowledge about the English language, the basics of informatics, strategic thinking, geography and history, teamwork, cultural knowledge, perspective change, and creativity during video gameplay. © 2021 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd..

The overall effect was moderately large, indicating favorability to the video-game based learning groups. We found evidence of effect-size heterogeneity with a large between-studies standard deviation, along with large Q and I2 values. Subgroup analyses produced mixed results when partially explaining effect-size variability. Furthermore, all publication bias tests indicated a low risk of publication bias.

Oculomotor activity is a well studied method of sampling; a mouse or a keyboard can also be used to access information past the current screen. We examine information access patterns of StarCraft 2 players at multiple skill levels. The first measures are analogous to existing eye-movement studies: fixation frequency, fixation targets, and fixation duration all change as a function of skill, and are commensurate with known properties of eye movements in learning. Actions that require visual attention at moderate skill levels are eventually performed with little visual attention at all. This (a) confirms the generalizability of laboratory studies of attention and learning using eye movements to digital interface use, and (b) suggests that a wide variety of information access behaviors may be considered as a unified set of phenomena. © 2020, The Psychonomic Society, Inc.","Attention in learning; Eye movements and visual attention; Perception and action","Attention; Eye Movements; Fixation, Ocular; Humans; Learning; Saccades; Video Games; Visual Perception; attention; eye fixation; eye movement; human; learning; saccadic eye movement; video game; vision","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85084118985"

Within the framework of the new critical museology, these organizations have been transformed into places of encounter and experience, the key tools in this change being socialization and play. Gamification are now intrinsic to collections and are a way of inviting visitors to share new museum experiences through the latest technology such as AR (Augmented Reality) and VR (Virtual Reality). In this way, the museum becomes a playground and a space for creativity (Borja-Villel et al., 2014). In this research, we focus on what we consider to be an important link between the three central aspects of museum change: sociability, gamificaction and virtualization; and the growing interest in museums for videogames. Our aim is to reach a better understanding of the AR and VR video games developed for museums and how these technologies can not only motivate visitors’ interest but also improve their learning skills. Our analysis focuses of literature published between 2015 to 2018 and follows the analytic structure established by Connolly et al.

Videogames are one of the most consumed entertainment industry products worldwide. For students, video games are spaces where to find their masculine identity. Therefore, education must include video games. Video games are used as an educational resource for the improvement of the teaching-learning process of students. However, the aim of this study is to propose a didactic method untitled VIGLIAM (acronym for Video Games Literacy from Alternative Masculinities). From this method, firstly, students deconstruct critically the hegemonic masculinity of the characters in video games. Secondly, students build critically and creatively alternative masculinities that promote a fairer and more equal society. From this way, students develop empowering and empathetic skills from categories as gender, race, class, sexual orientation, body and nature. In short, this research is part of masculinities studies in the area of education and it is fundamental in the light of the emergence of posmachism that arises given the possibility of the loss of male privilege. © 2021 Grupo de Investigacion FORCE.

The focal pedagogical intervention utilized mobile augmented reality (AR) activities, the development of which was inspired by research on learning ‘in the wild.’ Applying the principle of reverse engineering, we introduce a pedagogical approach termed ‘rewilding’ for its emphasis on designing supportive conditions for goal-directed interaction outside of classrooms. Three instances of AR materials use are presented from an out-of-class activity associated with university-level language courses involving a quest-type AR game called ChronoOps. Video data of 3-player groups were transcribed using conventions from multimodal conversation analysis. The empirical investigation illustrates meaning making through visible embodied displays, the performance of new actions through incorporation of public semiotic resources, and the contributions of the material surround as actants in the flow of interaction. Analysis illustrates that mobile AR activities enable languaging events among assemblages of environments, mobile devices, and embodied experience. We conclude by outlining the affordances of mobile AR activities as one example of rewilding approaches to creating material conditions for language use and learning. © 2020 The Authors.

Due to their social setting and tendency to stimulate intrinsic motivation, board games may constitute efficient learning tools for promoting socioemotional development in children. The current project therefore aimed at developing and testing three theory-driven board games explicitly targeting EC. First, we explored the quality of these EC games in terms of game experience, compared to off-the-shelf games (without an EC focus). Second, we tested whether targeted EC were linked to game experience in the EC games by measuring associations between children's trait EC and subjective effort and difficulty during gameplay. Materials and Methods: Children (N = 177) aged 8-12 years old were randomly assigned to a four-session protocol that comprised EC board games (experimental group) or off-the-shelf board games (control group). At baseline, participants' trait EC (emotion recognition, differentiation, and cognitive reappraisal) were assessed, while game experience (e.g., positive and negative affect, flow and immersion, difficulty, and effort) was assessed after each game. Results: Both groups perceived the games they played as positive and playable. Furthermore, regression analyses showed that higher trait EC was linked to lower self-reported effort and difficulty in two of the EC board games focusing on emotion recognition and differentiation. Conclusion: The present study shows that the board games on EC designed for children seem to elicit game experiences comparable to off-the-shelf games. Moreover, children's trait EC were linked to subjective game experience in two of the three games. Future interventions should examine the potential of the novel games to promote EC.  © Copyright 2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2020.","Board games; Cognitive reappraisal; Emotion differentiation; Emotion recognition; Emotional competences; Play","Child; Emotional Adjustment; Emotional Intelligence; Female; Humans; Male; Motivation; Social Skills; Socioeconomic Factors; Video Games; article; child; controlled study; female; human; human experiment; immersion; major clinical study; male; randomized controlled trial; school child; emotional intelligence; motivation; psychological adjustment; social competence; socioeconomics; video game","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85086345923"

Nevertheless, their effects on cognition have been scarcely explored, and no previous review has focussed on this relationship. The purpose of the research reported on here was to analyse the acute and chronic effects of the use of different EXs on the cognition of young people aged 6 to 18 years, to review potential confounders, and to elaborate a practical guide to using EXs in schools or extracurricular contexts. Studies were identified from 4 databases (Pubmed, SportDiscus, ProQuest and Web of Science) from January 2008 through January 2018. Thirteen studies met the inclusion criteria. All the studies showed a positive effect of EXs on cognition. The review showed an acute improvement effect on executive functions (EFs) (visual attention, mental processing, working memory, response inhibition, and motor planning) and chronic benefits on mathematical calculation, self-concept, classroom behaviour, and on parental and interpersonal relationships. Only 5 studies used confounders. EXs are an effective and motivating tool to improve cognition in young people aged 6 to 18 years.

This theory has had extensive theoretical development, but comparatively limited translation for clinicians in practice. This study is the first to present resilient healthcare principles in a serious video game. Serious games are an effective tool for engaging users, sharing ideas and eliciting reflections. The aim of this study was to communicate principles from resilient healthcare to clinicians through a serious video game, and to evaluate the game's feasibility as a prompt to reflect on practice. The game, Resilience Challenge, is scenario-based and requires players to resolve dilemmas in clinical practice. It was disseminated online, and was played 1949 times during the four-month study. The game was evaluated using an immediate cross-sectional survey, which included both Likert-style and free text responses. Participants reported that the game was engaging (93%) and that they would recommend it to others (89%). Fewer participants reported learning about resilient healthcare concepts (64%). Resilience Challenge is a promising way to prompt reflections about clinical work, and demonstrates mixed outcomes in communicating resilient healthcare principles to clinicians. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Feasibility; Gamification; Healthcare; Reflection; Resilience; Resilience engineering; Resilient healthcare; Safety II; Serious games; Serious video game; Survey","Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Delivery of Health Care; Feasibility Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Organizational; Quality of Health Care; Resilience, Psychological; Staff Development; Video Games; Health care; Human computer interaction; Adaptive capacity; Clinical practices; Clinical work; Cross-sectional surveys; Effective tool; Quality healthcare; Scenario-based; Theoretical development; adult; article; clinical practice; feasibility study; female; human; human experiment; learning; male; video game; cross-sectional study; feasibility study; health care delivery; health care quality; middle aged; nonbiological model; organization and management; personnel management; procedures; psychological resilience; psychology; video game; Serious games","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85083642587"

However, this crucial element is barely investigated within educational video games, as educational psychology research focuses mainly on supportive role models (e.g., pedagogical agents, intelligent tutorial systems). Nevertheless, the influence on learning must be explored, as interaction with an opponent might accompany the whole learning process. Thus, an experiment was conducted comparing three forms of social competition with an emphasis on external valid applications. More specifically, playing against a human competitive agent, playing against an artificial competitive agent, and playing against an artificial leaderboard were compared. Additionally, methods of adaptive difficulty adjustment were included within these groups to harness the potential of artificial systems. The results of the study (N = 102) revealed a beneficial effect of adaptive mechanisms on learning performance and efficiency. Furthermore, a difference in play behavior could be observed. The participants reported a lowered feeling of shame, increased empathy, and behavioral engagement when facing competitive agents. In contrast, calculations revealed no significant impact on mental strains by potentially demanding social competitors. These results highlight the potential for the future development of adaptive game systems and help choose the optimal implementation of social competition within different educational video games. © Copyright © 2020 Nebel, Beege, Schneider and Rey.","adaptivity; artificial social competition; dynamic difficulty adjustment; educational video games; game-based learning; serious games","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089432485"

Data would be analysed quantitatively using percentages. Researcher gained information using indicator derived from front-end analysis by Lee Owen, they were audience analysis, technology analysis, critical-incident analysis and media analysis. Audience analysed showed that students prefer learning using visual style than verbal and auditory style. Technology analysis showed that students' interest in learning using video got the highest percentage (89,9%) than game (68,4%) and LMS (78,9%). Critical incident analysis gained information about students' enjoyment using online learning (74,5%), students' understanding using online learning (36,8%), then students' desire to keep continue studying using online learning (15,8%). Printed media showed that All of the students had their own mobile (100%) and owned internet access (86,8%) but only 52,6% students had ease in accessing the internet. The main result showed that students were unsatisfied with this kind of learning. 84,2% students did not want to continue learning using this way. Lack of facilities, especially internet connections could be the main cause. Some suggestions were given that the further researcher can prepare a learning model that is combined online and offline learning.  © 2020 by authors.","Learning from Home; Online Learning; Students Perception","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85096230014"

During recent decades, much attention has been paid to video games and the multifarious ways in which they can promote and enhance learning. Îy main objective in this study is to weave game principles, learning and the notion of playfulness into assessment principles, in an attempt to investigate how what I call 'Game-Informed Playful Assessment' (GIPA) can affect student learning and particularly students' experience of learning. The GIPA was designed with a view to promoting students' agency, autonomy, collaboration and playfulness, and was introduced in an undergraduate course on Archaic Greek Lyric poetry at a Greek-speaking university. My data was generated through in-depth interviews with ten of the students that attended the course. While the GIPA was favourably and even enthusiastically received by students, the research also brought to the fore several other issues that call for attention, such as the stress that innovative assessment may provoke in students, and the readiness of students to be playful within an academic framework that typically contrasts serious work with playfulness and play in general.

Nevertheless, instructors can be influenced by barriers that prevent them from using EVGs in their courses (e.g. lack of expertise with EVGs). Instructors can also be influenced by different drivers that might increase their intention to use EVGs. This research analyses the effects of four variables (perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, attention, and relevance) as factors contributing or preventing the use of EVGs by instructors serving in Higher Education institutions. Data of 170 instructors, who were surveyed through an online questionnaire using a snowball sampling, is analysed via fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA). Main results suggest that perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use of EVGs are sufficient conditions for Higher Education instructors to show behavioural intention to use EVGs in their courses. Results also suggest that both instructors’ perceived capacity of EVGs to attract students’ attention and perceived relevance of EVGs affect instructors’ behavioural intention. Managerial implications for Instructor Training Programmes (ITP), limitations of the study, and future research lines are also addressed. © 2019, Association for Educational Communications and Technology.","Educational video games; fsQCA; Higher education; Instructors’ intentions","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85061358754"

In addition, we tested relations between anger reduction and learning and, in a subset of participants, between narrative quality and learning. A sample of 248 young people (eight to 17 years old) recalled an anger-provoking experience and were randomly assigned to one of four activities: recalling the event a second time; narrating the event; and distraction (via video game play or conversation). The young people then recalled the event one last time, and rated the extent to which they had learned from that event.

Re-Mission 1, developed by HopeLab Industries, is a computer game that can be used by pediatric cancer patients to educate and prepare them for what they will experience in terms of cancer progression and treatment (Tate, Haritatos, & Cole, 2009). Pediatric patients who played this game were found to have improved motivation and self-understanding of their illness (Kato, Cole, Bradlyn, & Pollack, 2008). Seeing the success of Re-Mission 1, ReMission 2, a series of six different games that includes Re-Mission 2: Nanobot’s Revenge, was developed. The purpose of the present study was to see if Re-Mission 2: Nanobot’s Revenge would lead to an understanding of cancer physiology in the same way as Re-Mission 1, as well as to compare the relative effectiveness of text-and game-based materials in terms of their educational value (at short-and long-term intervals). The results indicated that playing Re-Mission 2: Nanobot’s Revenge yielded significant educational benefits similar to Re-Mission 1. Furthermore, while both the text-and game-based methods were effective educational tools for teaching participants about cancer physiology and treatment, the text-based method led to significantly higher memory recall than the game-based method. The use of video games further aided in memory persistence, which is important for the long-term nature of cancer diagnoses and accompanying treatments. © 2020, North American Journal of Psychology.

We use phenomena to illustrate the melding of real-world scientific investigation, research, and practices with science teaching found in middle and high school settings. Interested students are more motivated, curious, and attentive. This increases the likelihood that they will not only learn the material to a greater degree, but also retain the information longer.

Video games have become so widespread and pervasive that they are now considered a part of the mass media, a common method of storytelling and representation. Despite the massive popularity of video games, their increasing variety, and the diversification of the player base, until very recently little attention was devoted to understanding how playing video games affects the way people think and collaborate across cultures. This paper examines the recent literature regarding the impact of video games on players from an intercultural perspective. Sixty-two studies are identified whose aim is to analyze behavioral-change, content understanding, knowledge acquisition, and perceptional impacts. Their findings suggest that video games have the potential to help to acquire cultural knowledge and develop intercultural literacy, socio-cultural literacy, cultural awareness, self-awareness, and the cultural understanding of different geopolitical spaces, to reinforce or weaken stereotypes, and to some extent also facilitate the development of intercultural skills. The paper provides valuable insights to the scholars, teachers, and practitioners of cultural studies, education, social studies, as well as to the researchers, pointing out areas for future research. © 2020 JESTP.","Digital game-based learning; Educational technology; Impact of video games; Intercultural skills; Video games","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85079862933"

Changes in the technological and social conditions of modern society need new professional skills, which are often called ""21st century skills"". These skills should be developed starting from the primary school, as they are psychological and behavioural, rather than practical. Game-based learning and gamification are effective means of such skills development. The use of video games in teaching practice is studied multifaceted, along with formats and requirements of educational game, methods for effectiveness assessment, and the effect of games on students. The controversial nature of game-based learning effect on students require deeper research, as the increase in motivation and learning efficiency cannot be disputed, as well as the negative impact of a long gaming on cognitive abilities, emotional state and social skills of students. The study tested both an increase in the motivation and attraction of school students for the learning process, and the impact on the practical results of information assimilation. There was conducted a survey on the results of the application of game training to determine the motivation and attraction of students. Likewise, we counted time, spent by the study and control group, for mastering the main educational material and the post-class study of game content and the educational material it presents. A comparative test was conducted on the results of educational material comprehension to determine the effectiveness of the methodology in mastering knowledge. The group, with game-based learning and gamification applied, showed an increase in motivation and attraction to learning, students paid additional efforts for assimilating the material studied, and also showed significantly higher learning outcomes compared to the control group. © Kassel University Press GmbH.","21th century skills; E-learning; Game-based learning; Gamification","Behavioral research; Gamification; Human computer interaction; Motivation; Digital environment; Educational materials; Effectiveness assessment; Game-based Learning; Learning efficiency; Professional skills; Skills development; Teaching practices; Students","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85090770609"

The situation is similar in Central Asian classrooms where it received little attention. Specifically, this study investigates a classroom in a local public school in Kazakhstan through the lens of a teacher and the students during speaking activities. A case study qualitative approach was employed using interviews, classroom observations, and document analysis as data collection methods. In total, 21 individual interviews and 30 hours of classroom observations were conducted and recorded. Analyses and interpretations of data show that firstly the speaking activities lack in negotiation of meaning as they are predominantly aimed at predetermined monological performance-based speech. Secondly, out-of-school learning was prevalent among the majority of students at private learning centres. Also, self-learning at home was practiced by male students via interacting with foreign players in online video games and by female students via watching English movies. Thirdly, classroom interactions were accountable in facilitating and inhibiting the practice of speaking. Finally, there was a mismatch between the perceptions of the teacher and the students on the challenges of the speaking practice. The teacher indicated insufficient teaching hours and students' limited background knowledge, while the students emphasised the teacher's unwillingness to use English as a language of instruction and to practice impromptu speech in class. In summary, the findings highlight some of the apprehensions faced by the teacher and the students which reveals the current English speaking practice in Kazakhstani classroom. © 2020 Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia.

Case specificity of learning outcome elicited by Serious Games has not been studied in detail. This study investigated whether learning outcome elicited by repeated exposure to virtual patient cases is transferable to other cases addressing similar problems. Methods In this monocentric, prospective, randomized trial, 69 fifth-year medical students participated in ten 90-minute sessions of using a computer-based emergency ward simulation game. Students were randomized to 3 groups (A, B, AB) and subsequently exposed to up to 46 different virtual patients. Group A was presented with 2 specific cases that were not shown in group B and vice versa. Group AB was exposed to all 4 specific cases. After 6 weeks of using the game as a learning resource, students were presented with 4 cases addressing similar problems. For each case, an aggregate score reflecting clinical reasoning was calculated, and performance was compared across groups. Results In the final session, there were no significant between-group differences regarding the sum score reflecting aggregated performance in all 4 cases (A: 66.5 ± 7.2% vs. B: 61.9 ± 12.4% vs. AB: 64.8 ± 11.1%, P = 0.399). An item-by-item analysis revealed that there were no between-group differences regarding correct therapeutic interventions. Conclusions Previous exposure had limited impact on subsequent performance in similar cases. This study suggests that case specificity of learning outcome elicited by the serious game is low and that acquired higher-order cognitive functions may transfer to similar virtual patients. © Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.","case specificity; clinical reasoning; Serious Games; undergraduate medical education","Clinical Competence; Clinical Reasoning; Education, Medical, Undergraduate; Female; Humans; Learning; Male; Prospective Studies; Video Games; adult; article; clinical article; clinical reasoning; controlled study; emergency ward; female; human; learning; male; medical education; medical student; outcome assessment; prospective study; randomized controlled trial; simulation; clinical competence; organization and management; prospective study; video game","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85082881645"

This study aimed to examine learning progress in placement of dental implants among dental students using dynamic navigation on a simulation model. Materials and Methods: Senior students with no implant placement experience were randomly assigned five implant placement attempts involving either three maxillary or four mandibular implants distributed in the anterior/posterior, and left/right segments. Implant placement was planned using a Navident Dynamic Guidance system. Surgical time was recorded. Horizontal, vertical and angulation discrepancies between the planned and placed implant positions were measured using superimposed CBCT scans. Data were analysed with repeated measures regression with Tukey's adjusted pairwise comparisons (α = 0.05). Results: Fourteen students participated, with a mean age of 26.1 years and equal males and females. Mean time for implant placement was associated with attempt number (P < 0.001), implant site (P = 0.010) and marginally related to gender (P = 0.061). Students had a significant reduction in time from their first attempt to their second (10.6 vs 7.6 minutes; adjusted P < 0.001) then plateaued. Overall 3D angulation (P < 0.001) and 2D vertical apex deviation (P = 0.014) improved with each attempt, but changes in lateral 2D (P = 0.513) and overall 3D apex deviations (P = 0.784) were not statistically significant. Implant sites were associated with lateral 2D, 2D vertical and overall 3D apex deviation (P < 0.001). Discussion: Males were marginally faster than females, had slightly lower overall 3D angulation, and reported higher proficiency with video games. Novice operators improved significantly in speed and angulation deviation within the first three attempts of placing implants using dynamic navigation. Conclusion: Computer-aided dynamic implant navigation systems can improve implant surgical training in novice population. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

The study first addresses whether the popular video game Minecraft provides the much needed diverse context and situated learning for EFL learners to engage in conversations. It next examines the vocabulary encountered by players in Minecraft itself to demonstrate the potential vocabulary coverage that learners would be exposed to while playing Minecraft. And finally, it analyzes the spoken language produced by a pair of L2 learners to corroborate that their vocabulary coverage during gameplay recapitulated the language found in these videos and in the game itself, to an extent greater than would be expected of their peers. The study shows that L2 learners need to know 4000-6000 word families to understand 95% of the words in Minecraft gameplay videos. The Minecraft blocks and items vocabulary contains 60% of 3k words and 30% of 4k-14k words from the Brown National Corpus, whereas 9% of the words encountered in Minecraft are not found in the 14k BNC list. These are words that may be common to native speakers of English but that L2 learners are not likely to encounter outside of class. In this case, learners may increase the breadth of their vocabulary knowledge more easily by being exposed to these less frequent words from watching Minecraft videos and playing the game. Finally, the results from analyzing second language learner Minecraft gameplay show that 95% of the vocabulary, including proper names and marginal words, are from the 2,000 most frequent word lists and 5% were from the 3k-14k word lists. The study concludes that, for L2 learners of English, Minecraft YouTube videos can serve as authentic language input sources with rich vocabulary coverage. © Copyright rests with authors.

Learning outcomes were measured by immediate knowledge tests and global exams. The multimedia model was developed containing activities used either through multimedia presentations, or in a traditional manner, such as using printed text and picture. Multimedia presentations, created according to the multimedia learning principles, represented multimedia instructional and motivational messages. They consisted of six groups of activities: association games, videos, interactive stories, interactive maps, visual stimuli, and crossword puzzles and quizzes. Field quasi-experiment was conducted with the experimental group exposed to instructional and motivational message on computer, and the control groups exposed to the message by traditional teaching aids. The participants were 170 pupils from four Croatian schools. The experimental group consisted of 97 and the control group of 73 students. Using multimedia instructional messages gave better learning outcomes, measured by immediate knowledge tests, while the effect was partially visible in the more global exams.

Given the high level of interaction between the players and the games they play, it is to be expected that much of how real-life representations are built in our minds will, in one way or another, influence how we interact with virtual reality, impacting on the playability of a game. Studies on the role of metaphors in (video)games are rather recent and much is yet to be investigated. Through simulations of family life and school routine, for example, these games imply human behavior as systematic and goal-oriented. For this study, we selected popular free life simulation games available at a popular App Store for smartphones. When listing the existing metaphors, we noticed a systematic difference: while conceptual metaphors were multimodal, consisting of a combination of verbal and visual information, primary metaphors showed to be intrinsically monomodal, consisting of visual information. In this study, we argue that metaphors in life simulation games start off as text-dominant, but become image-dominant after some time. That is, players rely on both images and verbal cues while learning how to play the games, but after some time they can just look at the symbolic cues for information. We therefore propose that the classification for metaphors in games should be continuous and as dynamic as the game itself, since there seems to be a movement from text-dominant to visual-dominant metaphors throughout the games. © 2020, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Faculdade de Letras.

Many complications can arise if diabetes is poorly managed. Hence, the need for adequate knowledge, skills, and ability to care for oneself, known as diabetes self-care management, is needed to reduce complication rates. We used an interactive platform that incorporates principles of gamification to enhance user engagement to enhance diabetes knowledge. The purpose of this descriptive pilot study was to discover what adult patients with diabetes thought about this novel educational approach to diabetes education. Materials and Methods: We collected focus group data from participants at a diabetes clinic after they played an interactive diabetes trivia game, on our software platform (Kaizen Education). Transcripts were coded and common themes were identified. Results: We conducted 9 focus groups that included 33 adult (age >18) participants who had diabetes. An overarching theme of play/gaming as a form of learning was apparent, and after analyzing the coding several themes emerged, including preferences and desired environments (clinic and home) for learning, desired players (including family, significant others), and a good balance of question difficulty. Conclusions: Participants were overwhelmingly positive about gamified education and felt empowered to lead discussions with their health care providers about diabetes self-care education, in a sense ""flipping"" the traditional clinic patient education paradigm. These results suggested that a flipped clinic approach could be beneficial, empowering, and engaging for patients. © Copyright 2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2019.","Diabetes education; Game platforms; Kaizen","Adult; Diabetes Mellitus; Female; Focus Groups; Games, Recreational; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Education as Topic; Pilot Projects; Self Care; Video Games; adult; diabetes mellitus; female; human; information processing; male; middle aged; patient education; pilot study; procedures; recreational game; self care; video game","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85075547315"

They offer learners a fun and convivial learning environment. However, the use of an educational video game genre that is ill-suited to a type of learning situation or inconsistent with the learners' motivational profile influences the effectiveness of its use in the classroom. In this context, this article deals, on the one hand, with the coherence between the genre of video games and the type of learning situation found in the context of the competency-based approach. On the other hand, it presents the results of a survey to describe the Moroccan learners' motivational profile in video games. The results show that the games should be adapted to each type of learning situation, designed and chosen to meet the learners' interest and avoided when learners are not interested in the genre of the games. It is also pointed out that most of learners prefer to use video games at the level of the explanation of the lessons and the exercises. In light of this research, we have made a number of recommendations for choosing and designing an educational video game.

Various open educational resources such as videos, simulations, and learning games are readily available on the Web. In addition, mobile and classroom technologies, such as portable devices can be considered as teaching tools in education. The good use of these educational resources and technologies can not only assist students’ formal classroom learning but also cultivate the self-regulated learning of students. The i-Classroom implemented in an elementary school adopted a new teaching method, which made use of the online educational resources and information technology, to achieve this goal. Three surveys (Sample size N = 149, N = 168, N = 150) were conducted to investigate the effectiveness of promoting three key aspects of self-regulated learning: learning motivation, planning and management, and self-monitoring. Focus group interviewed was also carried out to collect the feedback in i-classroom learning. The results show that i-Classroom can help students to enhance their ability in self-regulated learning. © 2019, Beijing Normal University.","Learning motivation; Open educational resources; Planning and management; Self-monitoring; SELF-regulated learning","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85070398578"

Utilizing a mixed-methods design, data were collected using a survey questionnaire that comprised 18 items and semi-structured oral interviews from 101 Saudi undergraduate students majoring in English Language and Translation at a public university in Saudi Arabia. The quantitative results reveal that participants have generally had positive learning outcomes from their accumulative gaming experiences, although accumulative gaming is seen to have greater potential for the development of receptive skills rather than productive skills in the target language. In particular, video games appear to foster learning and practicing of particular language skills and subskills, namely listening, speaking, reading, vocabulary, and pronunciation more than others. The qualitative findings provide further evidence of positive learning experiences of EFL due to gaming: the acquisition of new words encountered in gaming using learning strategies such as translation, enjoyment of the game as a salient, inherent factor that is conducive to learning as opposed to game difficulty as a hindering factor; and the possibility for video games based on adventure stories to activate the English learning mode. Last but not least, some advantages and obstacles pertinent to learning through the environment of massively multiplayer online video games (MMOG) were identified by learners. © Centre for Language Studies National University of Singapore.","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85102287674"

Participants were measured on their problem-solving skills before and after 20 hours of video gameplay. Two measures were used to assess problem-solving skills for this study, the Tower of Hanoi and The PISA Problem Solving Test. The Tower of Hanoi measured the rule application component of problem-solving skills and the PISA Problem Solving test measured transfer of problem-solving skills from video gameplay to novel scenarios on the test.

As part of this effort, this study directly compared student-rated effectiveness scores of six different learning modalities. Methods: Study participants included 286 medical students enrolled in the second-year rheumatology core at a single academic medical center between 2013 and 2017. Students were surveyed at the end of the core with a 15-item questionnaire, and student perceived effectiveness of six different learning modalities were compared. Results: The modality that outperformed all others was Live Patient Encounters (LPE), with significantly higher student-rated effectiveness scores when compared to the referent modality of Problem-Based Learning (PBL). Using a 5-point Likert scale with responses ranging from ""not effective"" to ""highly effective,"" LPE received a mean effectiveness score of 4.77 followed by Augenblick (4.21), PBL (4.11), Gout Racer video game (3.49), Rheumatology Remedy e-module (3.49), and simulation knee injection (3.09). Conclusions: Technologically advanced novel learning strategies were outperformed in this study by the more traditional active learning modality of LPE. This finding highlights the importance of testing innovative learning strategies at the level of the learner. Three additional conclusions can be drawn from this result. First, conflation of technology with innovation may lead to a myopic view of educational reform. Second, human factors seem to be responsible for the success of LPE and may have far-reaching educational rewards. Third, further applications of LPE should be tested in non-rheumatologic curricula. The relevance of this study is innately tied to the humanities-based application. While a formal qualitative analysis was not performed in this study, preliminary results suggest that live, structured patient interactions in the pre-clinical years of medical education may not only promote the learning of important educational objectives but also foster professional development, empathy, reflection, leadership, agency, and interpersonal skills. This ""win-win"" scenario (if true) would stand out as a rarity among strategic educational initiatives. © 2020 The Author(s).","","Education, Medical, Undergraduate; Humans; Problem-Based Learning; Rheumatology; Surveys and Questionnaires; education; human; medical education; organization and management; problem based learning; questionnaire; rheumatology","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85079080331"

However, schoolchildren who are in the formative stage of life, particularly in low-income countries like Nepal, are deprived of such a lifesaving skill. This study investigates the effectiveness of a school-based participatory action research intervention to promote handwashing with soap among basic level community school students in Nepal. Teachers, the school management committee, the participatory action research committee, and child-club members actively participated in designing and implementing the intervention. This study employed a semi-structured interview with the headteacher, five focus group discussions, and spot observations during 50 handwashing with soap events involving students, to collect the data. This study assesses the handwashing situation of students before and after the intervention. As part of the intervention, participatory teaching methods such as singing, drawing, showing a video, games, and demonstrations were used. Findings from basic level students who actively participated in hygiene sessions and increased their handwashing with soap before meals and after toilet use were used as a comparison to baseline. Participants reported that the intervention was perceived positively, pragmatic, and cost-effective. This intervention study concluded that handwashing behaviors improved because of the influence of sensitization sessions and demonstrations about handwashing. However, some predominant issues in the teaching of handwashing practices include limited hygiene contents in the curriculum and the practical use of teaching and learning activities. The lack of availability of soap at handwashing stations is the main barrier in sustaining handwashing behaviors in schoolchildren. © 2020, IWA Publishing.

This paper investigates the implications of scaffolding variations for how students make sense of a game-based exhibit that was designed to trigger interest and develop knowledge of scientific phenomena. The data were gathered during a field trip by high school students (aged 16–17 years) to a science center. The activity was part of a larger design-based research project, and this study focuses on students’ encounters with a single exhibit while in small groups. The group arrangements are characteristic of how learning activities are organized on field trips and represent three common conditions for scaffolding: (1) peer-supported, (2) teacher-assisted, or (3) facilitated by a museum guide. Interactions in each condition were video-recorded, transcribed, and subsequently scrutinized using interaction analysis. The analysis shows how framing, dialogic approaches, and the game-based exhibit facilitated sense making within and across the different conditions. The paper considers the scaffolding intentions and means of each condition and discusses the consequences of the variations for the students’ conceptual learning. The complexity of science center exhibits is also considered, as the study identifies scaffolding challenges related to interactions with dense and comprehensive analogue and digital resources. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Conceptual learning; Field trip; Framing; Scaffolding; Science center","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85064480972"

Materials and Methods: This study included a total of 117 college students (20.1 ± 2.9 years). They belonged to two different class groups, one formed the intervention group (IG, n = 58) and another one the control group (CG, n = 59). IG college students followed a 16-week gamification teaching program focused on encouraging physical activity (PA) through a game-based mobile app. The program was named ""$in TIME"" and set in the ""In Time"" science fiction movie. Each student belonging to the IG had a countdown on their mobile app so they had to perform learning and PA challenges to gain time. Thus, they had to run or cycle 3 to 5 days per week to gain time of life. The CG followed a traditional teaching methodology instead. CRF was assessed preintervention and postintervention using the 20-meter shuttle run test (20mSRT). Results: The stages completed in 20mSRT and the estimated maximal oxygen consumption at postintervention were significantly different between groups (P < 0.001, d ≤ 0.7), with a mean difference of 1.2 stages and 3.69 mL/(kg·min), respectively. Analysis within group showed a significant pre-post improvement only in the IG of 1.4 stages (P < 0.001). Conclusion: A gamification program, including the use of a game-based mobile app in a university setting, had a significant effect on the CRF in college students, in comparison with a CG that follows a traditional teaching methodology. © Copyright 2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.","Aerobic fitness; Health; Innovation; University; Young adults","Adolescent; Analysis of Variance; Female; Humans; Male; Mobile Applications; Oxygen Consumption; Physical Fitness; Students; Universities; Video Games; Young Adult; adolescent; analysis of variance; female; fitness; human; male; mobile application; organization and management; oxygen consumption; physiology; psychology; student; university; video game; young adult","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85079078645"

For speakers of English as a Second Language (L2), gaming provides access to the wider English-speaking community of English as lingua franca speakers (Jenkins 2015; Kachru 1986). According to Thorne et al. online games “comprise the most socially and cognitively complex forms of interactive media currently available” (2009: 808). To this end, gamers use language through a variety of modes, including speaking and writing. In addition, the skills and capacities needed to instant-message whilst gaming are forming new types of literacy and communication (Godwin-Jones 2004). In accordance with online language learning theories which argue that language learning occurs “in the wild” (Thorne 2010: 144), online interaction can give L2 speakers access to “real talk” rather than the simulated or role-played talk of the second language classroom (Kohn & Hoffstaedter 2017). Motivation for learning a language for gaming can therefore be aligned to intrinsic motivational language learning models (Ryan & Deci 2000; Wæge 2007). The present study considers French youths who use online games in English and asks what makes the language and environment of gaming an accessible way to learn English. The methods used were an online survey and interviews of students at the University of Bordeaux who reported on how gaming helped them to improve their English through immersion. The results show that the online nature of the exchanges between the speakers made the speakers feel more confident when trying to communicate in English (both within the game and when interacting with others in English when not gaming). In addition, the repetitive nature of games and gaming vocabulary helped the participants to learn English words and phrases without the impression of being drilled. The immersive experience facilitated by games gave L2 speakers of English the ability to travel virtually outside of their L1 local language environment. © 2020 All rights reserved.","English language learning; Games; Motivation; Online gaming; Video games; Virtual learning environment","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85108308403"

These characteristics assist general approaches for learning mazes game personalization applied to embedded mini-games (designed as information units, learning objects and educational tasks) so that to be adjustable and to enable learners to acquire knowledge more effectively. Design/methodology/approach: A student modelling approach was applied to design the personalization of learning content in the educational maze game and each of them contained mini-games. To evaluate the student’s preferences about the types of mini-games and ways of their personalization depending on individual and group student characteristics, the authors conducted an online survey. Findings: This study presents examples of personalization of four types of mini-games available in maze halls, namely, question, searching, arranging and action games. Next, the research discusses findings from an online survey aiming at the evaluation of the preferred types of mini-games and the way of their personalization. There are analysed results concerning the impact of the student model characteristics on the preferred ways of personalization in educational maze games, together with criteria for personalization of educational resources according to student’s level of knowledge, age, goals and learning style. Research limitations/implications: A significant limitation of the research is the relatively small number of survey participants and the lack of studying the impact of learning and playing styles over game personalization. Another limitation of the study is the inclusion of only some of the mini-games within the demonstration maze, which respondents play before answering the survey questions. Originality/value: This paper presents original research on the personalization of educational maze game based on a model of the student profile that comprises both static and dynamic properties reflecting user, learner and player-related aspects of the student character, together with results obtained from an online survey. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","APOGEE; Game-based learning; Maze; Personalization; Video games","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85099424186"

Conversely, “exergames” utilise 3D sensor control systems (eg, Kinect®) to offer full body interactive user experiences in which FMS outputs are often part of the game “play” experience. This study evaluated the impact that participation in (1) commercial exergames and, (2) purpose-built exergames had on user locomotor skill outcomes (run, hop, skip, jump and slide) when both sets of games were deployed with a “principled” human-in-the-loop personalisation process. Typically developing children aged between 5 and 6 years were divided into two groups; a control group (n = 20; 45% girls) exposed to commercial exergames and, an experimental group (n = 20; 50% girls) exposed to purpose-built exergames. Gameplay was delivered daily, in the classroom, over a period of 8 weeks. The Test of Gross Motor Development-2 was utilised to assess children's locomotor skills at three time points (pre, interim and posttest). A mixed analysis of variance with repeated measures on time was conducted to evaluate results of the experimental group in comparison to the control group. A significant interaction effect was observed relating to Time × Group. Pairwise comparisons with a Bonferroni adjustment demonstrated that the experimental group made significant improvements for each locomotor skill (run, hop, skip, jump and slide) from pretest to posttest while the control group made significant improvements in only one locomotor skill (the slide) over the same timeframe. Results indicate that principled design and deployment of purpose-built exergames support high quality locomotor outputs and, improved outcomes over time. Practitioner Notes What is already known about this topic A majority of modern children do not possess proficient locomotor skills and cannot hop, skip or even run properly Teachers typically target motor skills in the Physical Education setting but these skills require regular personalised practice to improve performance 3D sensor controlled exergames provide a potential platform to target locomotor skill acquisition in the classroom, but currently lack the necessary design principles to improve user locomotor skill outcomes What this paper adds A suite of “principled” exergames with adaptable features to target locomotor skills in the classroom A human-in-the-loop deployment process that empowers the teacher to be a crucial component of the learning experience Empirical evidence to support the effectiveness of purpose-built exergames for locomotor skill acquisition purposes in the classroom Implications for practice and/or policy Educators can work with a gaming system to effectively deploy “short bouts” of 3D sensor exergameplay in the classroom and facilitate significantly improved locomotor skills in children. Design and development of educational technology could consider the teacher as a valuable “human intelligent system” capable of making decisions about the user and user experience that the system cannot. This could potentially transform effectiveness of educational technologies from both the teacher and learner perspective. © 2019 British Educational Research Association","","Educational technology; Intelligent systems; Man machine systems; Bonferroni adjustment; Design and Development; Experimental groups; Improve performance; Interaction effect; Learning experiences; Pair-wise comparison; Physical education; Mergers and acquisitions","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85075130621"

In a TSC, participants can use all available language resources, in all meaning-making situations. An ethnographic data collection and research design is used to capture the authentic language use in this practice. The study followed monthly science lessons at a primary school for 3 years (2012–2015) and was documented by four video cameras and four audio recorders. The data material also consists of recorded conversations with four students, newly arrived in Sweden at the time of the data collection. In addition, field notes, students’ texts and different teaching materials were collected. To analyze how the use of both first and second languages may affect the continuity of science learning in multilingual classroom activities, practical epistemology analysis is used. The analysis shows that a TSC is an asset in appropriating a new social practice for students with limited ability to understand and express themselves in the language of instruction. However, the analysis also reveals some situations within this practice, in which all available resources are not utilized. These situations seem to be consequences of low expectations of students with limited access to the language of instruction expressed in simplified language usage; contextualizing the subject matter to everyday experiences students may not share; and the complexity of translating and transforming scientific content from one national language into another (Arabic and Swedish) and between everyday and academic discourse. The study contributes to the field by illustrating the importance of supporting each student’s access to the language tools that constitutes the scientific subject matter, as well as promoting the use of all resources to relate this to prior experience for a continuity of learning in a multilingual science classroom. © 2019, The Author(s).","Appropriation; Continuity of science learning in multilingual classroom activities; Discursive languages; Language games; Translanguaging science classrooms","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85066043082"

The article analyses an iterative game development process in an online learning context. The empirical data is primarily based on an explorative case study of “Games for change”; a course held in 2018 in which master students from the international Nordic Visual Studies and Art Education (NoVA) design games that address issues in society. Throughout the course, the students from universities in Finland, Sweden and Denmark engaged in a cross-cultural collaboration across campuses. The purpose of the study was to explore how to establish an online space for joint design inquiry in the context of ‘games for change’ across time and space as well as cultural and professional barriers. The data used for analysis includes teaching observations, videos of play sessions, photos and visual representations, students’ reflection papers and students’ written and oral evaluations after completion of the course. The analysis is based on different problem-based learning (PBL) activities; lectures, video instructions, presentation-and feedback sessions, reflexive exercises and students’ self-directed design and learning processes in groups. As part of the game course, teachers presented game theory and exercises through videos and visualisations to support the students’ iterative game design processes. The analysis of the PBL activities shows that teachers’ video instructions relating theoretical game concepts to the students’ actual group work supported the introduction to the game field as well as their design processes. The balance between the value of video instructions with specific feedback and teachers’ time for preparation is a relevant issue for further exploration in online teaching. Moreover, findings show that the students’ visualisations and video productions exemplifying game situations created a visible reference point for further discussions in feedback sessions across campuses, which guided game development. Thus, the combination of inquiry approaches, critical game theory and design processes combined with students’ visualisations and video productions provides interesting connections for bridging gaps between cultures and professions, e.g. in art and games. By the rich and visual descriptions of PBL activities, student work and reflective evaluations, the exploratory case study can function as inspiration for applying similar approaches to new local contexts in higher education. © ACPIL.","Design as inquiry; Higher education; Online learning; Students as designers; Visual facilitation; Visualisations","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85094107030"

With the shift to online classes due to COVID-19, many wellness events were cancelled due to social distancing limitations. However, promotion of wellbeing was considered to be of utmost importance during this time due to rising levels of stress and social isolation among students. Description: The school’s Instagram and Facebook accounts were managed by a group of the university’s faculty for six weeks. Each week, different daily wellness themes were shared and participation by followers encouraged through quizzes, polls, or reposts. The Instagram stories and posting platforms were used routinely with select posts also shared via Facebook. A new hashtag was created and promoted to encourage additional posting and community building. Video stories were also shared of faculty expressing their mental/physical health challenges and subsequent coping mechanisms during COVID-19. Results: During the last six weeks of virtual learning, 280 stories and 23 posts were shared via Instagram. Shared stories included promotion of: cardiovascular exercise, weight training, yoga, music, media, gratitude, recognition, positive thinking, coping and games. Overall, 20 different faculty and staff were involved in sharing video stories to promote wellbeing. Of the 13 posts also shared to Facebook, a total of 10,429 people were reached. Conclusion: School social media platforms can be used to regularly connect virtually during times of crises. Promoting wellness activities can help engage students and faculty/staff to ensure they are focusing on their own wellbeing. With social distance regulations for the foreseeable future, pharmacy programs should consider using social media as a wellbeing tool for both student and faculty/staff engagement. © 2020, International Pharmaceutical Federation.

Denmark is one on the countries in Europe with the highest alcohol consumption among adolescents. Alcohol abuse is a risk factor for a variety of diseases and contributes as a significant factor to motor vehicle accidents. The application offers first-hand experiences with alcohol in a safe environment. This is done by simulating a party situation using 125 different 360-degree movie sequences and displaying it in a virtual reality headset. The users create their own experience through a choose your own adventure game experience. The experience is designed to acquire skills for recognizing and handling peer pressure, which has been found to be one of the main reasons for drinking initiation. These skills are acquired though experimental learning. The application is a product of a co-design process involving 10 students (aged 18-28) studying film making and game design at Askov Folk High School (a special kind of Danish boarding school without exams for young adults), Denmark, their teachers, alcohol experts from social services and researchers with expertise within health promotion, social marketing, VR, interaction design and game development. Additionally, 35 students from Askov Boarding School (aged 15-17) participated as actors and extras. This article contributes to research within development of 360-degree video applications for experimental learning with a practical example. The iterative design process of the application, containing exploration of key concepts, concept design, prototype design, pre-usability testing, innovation design and usability test is described, as well as our reflections on virtual experimental learning in the application. © 2020, Academic Publishing Ltd.

A systematic review has been carried out in this study. The aim of this paper is to investigate the psychometric properties of a study of a sample of Spanish gamers. Two hundred and thirty-seven children (mean age: 11.2± 1.17 years, range: 10-12 years, 59.5% female) completed the Gameplay-Scale to discover their opinions after a game session with a serious educational game. The final scale consisted of three factors. The fit for factor 1 (usability) was 0.712, the fit for factor 2 was 0.702 (satisfaction), the fit for factor 3 was 0.886 (empathy) and the overall fit was 0.868. A positive and direct relationship could be observed between all the dimensions of the developed scale. The greatest correlation strength is shown between satisfaction and empathy (r = 0.800; p < 0.005), followed by satisfaction and usability (r = 0.180; p < 0.05) and the association between empathy and usability (r = 0.140; p < 0.05). In summary, the results of the present study support the use of the Gameplay-Scale as a valid and reliable measure of the game experience of youth populations. These results demonstrate strong psychometric properties so that the Gameplay-Scale appears to be a valid instrument for children in different contexts where an educational video game is used, analyzing its usability/""playability"" in terms of learning to use it, game satisfaction, and empathy. © 2020 by the authors.","Computer game; Gamers; Properties psychometric; Validation; Video game","child care; education; human behavior; knowledge; learning; psychology; recreational activity","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85083052338"

It also ex-amined their feelings/attitudes towards this tool. Background Young students have trouble understanding concepts related to environmen-tal education and, specifically, concepts related to the endangered species. Spherical videos constitute an interesting alternative teaching tool, applicable in diverse scientific disciplines. Additionally, research in this field is rather unsystematic and fragmented, given that the underlying technology is still an emerging one. Methodology A three conditions within-subjects design was applied. Forty-nine, nine-to-ten years-old primary school students attending public schools in Athens, Greece were selected to participate in the project. They had never before been formally taught subjects such as the ones included in the study and had no prior experience in using Google Cardboard compatible head-mounted displays. The participating students were taught using printed material, web pages, and interactive applications in which spherical videos were embedded. The project lasted for nine two-teaching-hour sessions (three for each tool). Data were collected using nine evaluation sheets. About a third of the ques-tions in these tests assessed declarative knowledge, while the rest examined procedural and conditional knowledge. A validated scale was also used, de-signed to evaluate users' experience when using digital educational applica-tions. For analyzing the data (from both the evaluation sheets and the ques-tionnaire), several repeated measures ANOVA tests were conducted using SPSS 25. Contribution By examining the learning outcomes from the use of applications in which spherical videos were integrated, by contrasting their impact on knowledge with other tools, and by quantifying their differences, the present study ex-tends the-rather limited-literature regarding the educational uses of this technology. Given that there is a lack of a well-defined teaching framework, the study contributes towards this end, as a modified version of Bybee's 5Es was tested, with encouraging results. "" Findings Post-hoc pairwise comparisons revealed statistically significant differences in-dicating that students' performance when using the apps was better than their performance in the web pages and printed material. Statistically signifi-cant differences were also noted when analyzing the questionnaire's data. In detail, the analysis revealed that the apps were considered more motivating compared with both the printed material and the web pages. The same ap-plied to students' enjoyment. Also, their sense of presence was stronger. Then again, all tools were considered as being equally useful. Finally, no usa-bility issues were reported. Recommendations for Educators As the development of apps requires time and effort, a large pool of ready-made apps has to become available to educators. Spherical videos have to be used in the context of a well-defined teaching framework. A familiarization period on how HMDs are used and how to run and navigate in the apps will help to avoid usability issues. Education administrators have to implement reforms in the primary school timetable and curriculum, for achieving the seamless integration of this technology to everyday teaching. Recommendations for Researchers and Developers Motivation and enjoyment can be further enhanced by adding game-like fea-tures. Thus, software developers can consider adding such features and re-searchers can examine their effects. A lot more can be done for making the apps utilizing spherical videos easier to handle and navigate. For example, hand tracking can be used, which is a more natural interaction method. Future Research Besides larger sample sizes and more interventions, future research can ex-amine the impact of spherical videos on student misconceptions, attitudes, and behaviors towards environmental issues. It would be interesting to exam-ine the views and experiences of educators as well.

In the present research, a game-based learning in the physics domain with guides provided direct and immediate feedback. The research was conducted among three different groups: the traditional group, the educational video group, and the game-based learning group. The result showed that the game-based learning group performed the best among the three groups, followed by the educational video group, and the traditional group performed the worst. Students in the game-based learning group were enrolled into an interview to study which types of guides enhanced students’ game-based learning. From the interview, the prompts and the interactive characteristic of the game-based learning environment took the first two places. In addition, students benefited from the features of game-based learning including task requirements for execu-tion, the tip prompt function, the feedback mechanism, and the story settings. There-fore, it is necessary to integrate applicable guides into the design of game-based learning according to students’ perspectives for providing engaging learning experience. © 2020, Scientia Socialis Ltd.

Advances in gaming technology have encouraged the development of natural user interfaces (NUIs), which should provide a superior user experience as players are able to use preexisting mental models from physical interaction rather than learning an abstract mapping schema. However, anecdotal and previous empirical research suggest the opposite—gamers prefer more familiar-albeit-abstract gamepad controllers. Because the exact nature and mechanism of this preference remains open for investigation, we suggest two rivaling mechanisms related to novelty and learning. Comparing self-identified gamer regarding their last gamepad and NUIs experience in an online quasi-experimental survey design (N = 248), participants in the current study had less experience using NUIs, resulting in lower self-efficacy and enjoyment. Learning effects (via experience with a controller), rather than novelty effects (via exposure to a unique controller), seem to be the most relevant mechanism to understanding how controllers impact game enjoyment. However, both controller novelty and learning effects were significant mediators of the link between controller type and perceived controller naturalness. Our data suggest that perceptions of “natural” do not only depend on technological features of a user interface, but also on the user’s previous experiences with the device. As such, users need to build robust mental models of the controllers through experience, which over time become more natural with increasing proficiency.

Materials and Methods: A pre-/post-test/follow-up quasi-experimental design was used with an experimental and a control group (121 adolescents, 15.7% boys, mean age of 14.1 years). The training called ""EmotivaMente"" consisted of eight sessions lasting 1.5 hours each, conducted with six first-year classes of two Italian senior high schools. Data on emotional competences were collected at baseline, at the end of the training and 3 months later. Data were analyzed by repeated measures analysis of variance. Results: Students who participated in the EI training reported an improvement in the evaluation and expression of emotions in relation to the self (own emotions) compared with the control group, immediately after the training, but this difference did not persist at the follow-up (3 months later). Furthermore, EmotivaMente found an increase in the use of cognitive revaluation as a strategy of emotion regulation in the experimental group over time. Conclusions: EmotivaMente helped adolescents to improve emotional skills. Results confirmed that videogames can be useful to promote EI in adolescents at school, if integrated with a guided and assisted framework.

In the ""new ecology of learning"" it is becoming crucial to trace the paths of learning experiences that students develop both in school and outside it. Few research studies have focused on out-of-school activities. In this paper, we explore differences between children and adolescents in their participation through 26 out-of-school activities, and their subjective perception of the learning thus derived. Method. We designed a questionnaire to explore participation in out-of-school activities and the subjective value that students attribute to their learning experiences. The list of activities was determined through thematic analysis of 17 previous focus groups. Participants are 946 children, aged either 10 or 16, from public schools in Catalonia. Participation is analysed according to age, gender, SES, and students' area of residence. Data analysis is performed with SPSS software. Results. Trends in participation in out-of-school activities appear to differ according to participants' age and gender, whereas factors such as SES and area of residence have a very limited influence. Engagement in out-of-school activities shows a developmental pattern according to participants' age, as well as important gender-related differences (males are overrepresented in ""sports"" and ""playing video games"", while females show a greater preference for social-or academic-oriented activities). The whole sample rate academic-related activities as more important than other informal kinds of activities from which they also learn. Conclusions and Discussion. Schools need to be aware of the influence that gender stereotypes and social discourses about formal learning can have on the decision making of students. New ways of validating non-formal and informal learning experiences should be implemented to recognise and increase the social visibility of other formative experiences developed outside formal contexts. © Universidad de Almeria and Ilustre Colegio Oficial de la Psicologia de Andalucia Oriental (Spain).","Learning activities; Learning experiences; Out-of-school activities; Sociodemographic features","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091897553"

Objectives: This research proposes to promote STEAM skills through game-based learning.. Design: These were used to design an integrated educational proposal, called the Micro Play Project (MPL), following the principles of game-based learning and an intercultural approach focused on Ethnomathematics. Setting and Participants: This MPL was implemented in a Spanish school with small groups of students from Pre-school and Primary Education, dedicating three sessions to each of the four games, which were recorded on video. Data collection and analysis: Studying the Jamaican culture, we discovered that the game is a relevant cultural sign in Jamaica, we compiled and analyzed its traditional games, generating a catalog, from which we selected four games, for their potential to develop STEAM learning at school.Qualitative-interpretive research was carried out through a case study and content analysis, using a proprietary tool. Results: they are diverse skills, artistic, scientific and mathematical manifested when playing, such as: musical sense, detection of similarities, ability to turn, identification of shapes, estimation of distances, formulation of hypotheses and establishment of relationships by criteria, which have confirmed the didactic potential of these games, in an environment of ethnomathematical intercultural education. Conclusions: The validity of the MPL as a didactic method to develop STEAM learning is deduced from the results. We hope to strengthen and spread this method by making new elaborations and applications of MPL. © 2020 Lutheran University of Brazil.

This study had a pretest-posttest quasiexperimental design. The control and experimental groups comprised students at a Taiwanese university who were taught using the traditional teaching method (TT group; 48 students) and TMA (TMA group; 47 students). The pretest and posttest comprised the Learning Behavior Scale in Physical Education and a test questionnaire that assessed the students' knowledge of basketball game recording methods through 32 multiple-choice questions. The teaching procedure lasted 4 weeks and covered various aspects of the rules of basketball, including the methods of recording basketball game scores. Differences between the groups were determined using various statistical tests. The students' learning behaviors and knowledge of basketball recording methods were discovered to be significantly improved in both groups at the posttest. However, the TMA group outperformed the TT group, enhancing the students' learning behaviors and knowledge to a greater degree. Overall, a combination of TT and TMA may have the most beneficial effect on students' cognition and learning. Teachers should take their students' current cognitive development into consideration when designing course materials. © Kassel University Press GmbH.","Learning behaviors; Multimedia videos; Teaching materials; Teaching strategy","Basketball; Computer aided instruction; E-learning; Learning systems; Teaching; Cognitive development; Learning behavior; Multi-media learning; Multimedia video; Multiple choice questions; Teaching materials; Teaching strategy; Traditional learning; Students","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85079048580"

Along these lines, the paper confirms the didactic relevance to the transition from the real city to the digital one, allowing for the creation of a theoretical and empirical reflection on the method for use in an educational setting. The paper builds on the idea of how gaming offers a disembodied experience of the city, arguing for its didactic and social impact on a new generation of “smart learners.” © 2020.

Ingame instructions may account for the majority of such contributions. This study checks whether such instructions can pique the curiosity of participants and subsequently enhance their vocabulary acquisition. Ten 11 to 12-year-old pupils were recruited for a month-long video game experiment. Three instruments, including vocabulary tests, interview questions and observation checklists, were employed. The qualitative data were analysed to determine the key aspects of in-game instructions and how they enhance the vocabulary acquisition of these pupils. Findings show that not all participants have gained additional vocabulary from in-game instructions. Whilst all participants were interested in playing the video game, only four of them showed curiosity towards the in-game instructions. Therefore, the usefulness of in-game instructions fundamentally depends on the attitudes of players towards the game, the suitability of the language level being used in the game and the players' demand for such instructions. © 2020 Kassel University Press GmbH.","Curiosity; In-game instructions; Vocabulary acquisition","Curiosity; Game instructions; Language levels; Qualitative data; Video game; Vocabulary acquisition; Human computer interaction","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85082679923"

This experimental study was conducted in the fall semester of 2017-2018 for 11 weeks at a state university in Turkey and included a total of 56 pre-service teachers. An achievement test and a scale were implemented to collect the data. The analyses through descriptive and inferential statistical analysis techniques showed that flipped learning group obtained significantly higher achievement test scores and final grades than the traditional instruction group. On the other hand, being in the flipped learning group or in the traditional group had no significant effect on the pre-service teachers' perceptions of the classroom environment. Implications for practice or policy: • University administrators may organise in-service training programs for instructors on computer applications, software, and games as implementing them in courses may increase learner satisfaction and contribute to a more positive classroom environment. • Instructors need to consider the duration of lecture videos as videos should not be too long. • Instructors need to consider the length and content of lecture videos-students are more likely to come to class prepared if videos are kept to a manageable length and the content is ""chunked"". © Articles published in the Australasian Journal of Educational Technology.","Classroom environment perceptions; Flipped learning; Pre-service teacher education; Principles and methods of instruction course; Student achievement","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85083158203"

Methods: Participants included 27 children aged seven to 12 years (20 boys, seven girls) whose parents identified them as experiencing peer relationship difficulties or social anxiety. SAS featured a computer game and other spy-themed activities that children played during nine weekly 90 minute club meetings that were facilitated by University psychology clinic interns. The program also included weekly parent group training sessions, home missions (skills practice tasks) and weekly tip sheets that informed school staff about the skills that children were learning, and how they could support them in applying these skills in the classroom and playground. Program outcomes were evaluated using a range of parent- and child-report measures administered at pre-intervention, post-intervention and at six-week follow-up. Results: Results suggested that SAS led to significant improvements in children’s social skills as reported by parents (Fs (2, 25) ≥ 21.91, ps < 0.0001, partial ɳ2s ≥ 0.46), children’s social competence as reported by parents (F(2, 25) = 17.12, p < 0.001, partial ɳ2 = 0.58), children’s overall anxiety as reported by parents (F(2, 25) = 8.57, p = 0.001, partial ɳ2 = 0.41), and children’s social anxiety as reported by themselves (F(2, 25) = 7.14, p = 0.004, partial ɳ2 = 0.36).

However, many of them consider it difficult. Furthermore, many find these topics less appealing and not connected to their future specialization in different fields of clinical medicine. Student-centred strategies such as problem-based learning, gamification and the use of real data can increase the appeal of a difficult topic such as genetic testing, a field at the crossroads of genetics, molecular biology and bioinformatics. Methods: We designed an electronic teaching application which students registered in the undergraduate Medical Biology course can access online. A study was carried out to assess the influence of implementation of the new method. We performed pretest/posttest evaluation and analyzed the results using the sign test with median values. We also collected students' personal comments. Results: The newly developed interactive application simulates the process of molecular genetic diagnostics of a hereditary disorder in a family. Thirteen tasks guide students through clinical and laboratory steps needed to reach the final diagnosis. Genetics and genomics are fields strongly dependent on electronic databases and computer-based data analysis tools. The tasks employ publicly available internet bioinformatic resources used routinely in medical genetics departments worldwide. Authenticity is assured by the use of modified and de-identified clinical and laboratory data from real families analyzed in our previous research projects. Each task contains links to databases and data processing tools needed to solve the task, and an answer box. If the entered answer is correct, the system allows the user to proceed to the next task. The solving of consecutive tasks arranged into a single narrative resembles a computer game, making the concept appealing. There was a statistically significant improvement of knowledge and skills after the practical class, and most comments on the application were positive. A demo version is available at https://medbio.lf2.cuni.cz/demo-m/. Full version is available on request from the authors. Conclusions: Our concept proved to be appealing to the students and effective in teaching medical molecular genetics. It can be modified for training in the use of electronic information resources in other medical specialties. © 2019 The Author(s).","Bioinformatics; E-learning; Gamification; Genomics; Interactive teaching application; Medical databases; Medical genetics; Problem-based learning","Computational Biology; Computer-Assisted Instruction; Education, Medical, Undergraduate; Genetic Diseases, Inborn; Genetic Testing; Genetics, Medical; Humans; Molecular Medicine; Problem-Based Learning; Teaching; User-Computer Interface; Video Games; biology; computer interface; education; genetic disorder; genetic screening; human; medical education; medical genetics; molecular medicine; problem based learning; procedures; teaching; video game","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074075933"

Using multiple adjectives to describe a noun, however, is confusing to ESL students as there is a certain order to be followed, which contradicts or does not even exist in their L1. At the same time, students nowadays are prone to technologies. In this era of technology advancement, the use of Google Classroom as an online tool plays an important role in education. The teaching and learning process could be enhanced as numerous features of Google are available on this blended learning platform. Therefore, the study aimed to examine the effectiveness of utilizing short videos and online games via Google Classroom in teaching the order of adjectives to the students. The participants of the study were 67 ESL students from an urban secondary school. Action research was carried out and the data was collected by the means of pre-and post-tests. It was highlighted that the results from post-tests showed an increase compared to pre-tests. The findings had proven that the integration of Google Classroom positively enhanced the teaching and learning process rather than being the conventional grammar lesson, and facilitated students to master the focused grammar rule. Therefore, Google Classroom should be seen as a viable learning tool to be implemented in ESL classrooms. © IJSTR 2019.","ESL classroom; ESL students; Google Classroom; Grammar; Order of adjectives; Technology; Urban school","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077327228"

Digital games that simulate complex systems which include the pressing issues of today’s challenges may be a useful supplement to foster systems thinking. In this study, we develop a framework to assess the complexity of in-game systems. A subsequent analysis of a selection of current commercial strategy and simulation games shows how system complexity is designed differently in the various games. Based on these results, we make recommendations for the selection and use of different games in formal and informal learning contexts. © 2020 by the authors.

Using the gadget for a long duration will undoubtedly affect the quality of students if it is not directed to appropriate and beneficial use. After school, students are preoccupied with their gadgets so that they waste a lot of their time to play games and leave their homework undone. As a result, their interest in doing science assignments are meager. Gadget addiction and the low level of learning interest in carrying out tasks are the new problems in education. Therefore, efforts need to be made to overcome them. This study aims to determine the effectiveness of android application as student aid tools in understanding the task of Physics. The subjects of this research were all VIII graders of SMP Islam Terpadu Arrozaq Rantauprapat. The type of this research is quantitative with a pre-experimental design (one-shot case study). This study directed the students to utilize their gadgets in completing the task of physics. The instruments used in this research were the video-checking rubric and the effectiveness questionnaire. This research has been carried out for three months, and video-checking was carried out at the end of each month after the project assignments were collected.

While the lack of sociability has been pointed out as a representative problem of game use in general, this paper analyzed studies on the relationship between online video games and social competence. In this field, the view that the relationship in the online game may replace or complement the actual relationship and will potentially hinder the development of sociability currently faces a conflict with the opinion that online video games may not directly have a negative effect on sociability but rather result in a positive outcome by providing a social learning space. In a large scale survey that measured the use of online games, psychological characteristics, and social competence, no distinct relationship between game use and degradation of sociability was observed. Based on this analysis, we suggest that efforts are necessary to break away from the stereotype that online game play may cause a decline in sociability and to improve the validity of related research. © 2020","interactive digital media; online video game; social compensation hypothesis; social competence; social displacement hypothesis; stimulation hypothesis","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122950838"

Despite this frequency, ED providers are not adequately trained on how to discuss diagnostic uncertainty with these patients, who often leave the ED confused and concerned. To address this training need, we developed the Uncertainty Communication Education Module (UCEM) to teach physicians how to discuss diagnostic uncertainty. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the UCEM in improving physician communications. Methods: The trial is a multicenter, two-arm randomized controlled trial designed to teach communication skills using simulation-based mastery learning (SBML). Resident emergency physicians from two training programs will be randomly assigned to immediate or delayed receipt of the two-part UCEM intervention after completing a baseline standardized patient encounter. The two UCEM components are: 1) a web-based interactive module, and 2) a smart-phone-based game. Both formats teach and reinforce communication skills for patient cases involving diagnostic uncertainty. Following baseline testing, participants in the immediate intervention arm will complete a remote deliberate practice session via a video platform and subsequently return for a second study visit to assess if they have achieved mastery. Participants in the delayed intervention arm will receive access to UCEM and remote deliberate practice after the second study visit. The primary outcome of interest is the proportion of residents in the immediate intervention arm who achieve mastery at the second study visit. Discussion: Patients' understanding of the care they received has implications for care quality, safety, and patient satisfaction, especially when they are discharged without a definitive diagnosis. Developing a patient-centered diagnostic uncertainty communication strategy will improve safety of acute care discharges. Although use of SBML is a resource intensive educational approach, this trial has been deliberately designed to have a low-resource, scalable intervention that would allow for widespread dissemination and uptake.

This study investigated the nascent learning by engineering students (N = 183) about the relevance of ethics to engineering practice in a two-hour workshop that included recounts of experiences that were of immediate relevance to engineering interns and graduates, through use of videos and a serious game. Thematic analysis of qualitative responses highlighted that students gained understanding of how ethics influences engineering practice in general, and how ethical issues influence the work of engineering professionals. Exposing students to the presence of ethical issues in practice through immediately relevant examples early during their studies is likely to improve the way they approach ethics throughout their studies, and subsequently, the workplace. © 2020, © 2020 SEFI.","engineering education; ethics; role acquisition; serious game; video","Philosophical aspects; Serious games; Students; Engineering practices; Engineering professionals; Ethical dilemma; Ethical issues; Ethics in engineerings; Qualitative response; Thematic analysis; Use of video; Engineering education","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088038820"

Like the field of engineering, the aviation industry is dominated by men. Because the aviation industry forecasts a high demand for pilots, it is highly desirable to address gender diversity and improve teaching methods in pilot education. In this study, potential application areas for AR-supported pilot training were investigated by conducting a survey with 60 pilots and flight instructors (including 12 women). Typical AR use cases were presented in videos, and the pilots reported their preferences regarding similar or other AR applications used in different parts of the flight training program. AR navigation was the use case that was most frequently preferred by both female and male pilots. The majority of pilots agreed that AR could potentially be used in theoretical instruction, pre-flight aircraft inspection, and procedure training. In addition, both gender groups showed similar preferences for various gaming concepts that make learning more interesting and engaging, such as receiving positive feedback. However, a higher percentage of women than men reported that achieving a target or receiving points to successfully finish a task and answering questions during the game were satisfying. Including a story in the game to attract attention was preferred by a higher percentage of men than women. The results of this study can be used to design AR educational concepts that support gender diversity in pilot education and other technical domains. © 2020 by the authors.

The game focused on science curriculum including map models, map navigation, and landforms. Fifth-grade students (N = 594) interacted with CRYSTAL ISLAND - UNCHARTED DISCOVERY during six 50-min sessions over four weeks integrated with classroom instruction. The transfer activity required students to create an island on grid paper that included at least seven different landforms, a map navigation activity created for peers, and an attached map scale model. Results of multiple regression analyses revealed that when other variables were accounted for, none of the measured motivational variables including interest for the game, performance-approach goal orientation, mastery-approach goal orientation, or self-efficacy for science were significant positive predictors of transfer. Interestingly, video game self-efficacy was a significant negative predictor of transfer performance. Prior knowledge and change in science knowledge after gameplay were also significant predictors of transfer. Girls performed as well as boys on the transfer task despite completing less game quests and had significantly lower posttest content scores. Interest was a consistent predictor of performance for girls but not boys for in-game performance, posttest content scores, and transfer scores. Regression models were systematically less able to predict performance moving from content knowledge, to in-game performance, to transfer. Implications for the design of GBLEs to facilitate transfer are discussed. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Game-based learning; Gender; Motivation; Science; Transfer","Computer aided instruction; Geomorphology; Interactive computer graphics; Landforms; Motivation; Regression analysis; Students; Classroom instruction; Game-based Learning; Game-based learning environments; Gender; Multiple regression analysis; Science; Self-regulated learning; Transfer; Human computer interaction","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85076098586"

While it is shown that there is no significant relationship between existing game play habits and graduate attribute attainment, several broad observations are made. Students who do not play video games tended to score best, while those students who play games in a variety of modes (online and local cooperative play, team-based and other cooperative play) also scored better on measures of graduate attribute attainment. Assumptions about the development of graduate attributes over time are also challenged by the data presented here, which suggest there is little correlation between attribute attainment and years spent at university. The work suggests that, while video games may be used to develop graduate skills on campus, there is no strong correlation between existing game play habits and the attainment of certain transferable skills. © 2020 M.

By integrating system dynamics visualization tools within a set of debriefing activities, GBSD helps teachers make systems thinking an explicit goal of the gameplay and learning when they use available educational games in the classroom. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a design-based research methodology with the goals of validating GBSD and investigating the utility of GBSD across different contexts as a design source to develop game-based curriculum. Over the course of 12 months, the authors conducted one focus group interview and three design workshops with participating teachers and master teachers. Between the workshops, the team rapidly iterated the framework, as well as curricular materials, in collaboration with the teachers. Findings: The authors developed a curriculum unit that integrates systems dynamics visualization tools and a video game for middle school life science ecosystem curriculum. The unit was implemented by the three teachers who participated in the co-design. The implementations confirmed the flexibility of the unit because teachers created additional instructional materials that supplemented the GBSD protocol and addressed the unique limitations and needs of their classrooms. Originality/value: GBSD builds on system dynamics, which is a distinct academic discipline and methodology, and it uses its visualization tools, which are not widely used in the systems thinking educational literature. GBSD is also unique, in that it applies these tools within the debriefing activities developed for an off-the-shelf educational game. This paper illustrates how a design framework can be used to support teachers’ thoughtful integration of games in curriculum development. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Causal diagrams; Design-based research; Game-based learning; STEM; Structural debriefing; System dynamics; Systems thinking; Video games","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074405249"

Design: Participants completed a survey regarding prior surgery exposure and other confounding factors including previous video game experience and self-assessed hand-eye coordination. Following orientation to the laparoscopic simulator (LS) and robotic surgical simulator (RoSS), participants were timed performing the Balloon Grasp and Ball Drop tasks on the RoSS and the Peg Transfer and Ball Drop tasks on the LS. Participants were then randomized to either the laparoscopic or RoSS arm and timed performing the Ball Drop task 10 times and then reassessed performing the Ball Drop using the unpracticed modality. Setting: Clinical Simulation Laboratory at the University of Vermont Participants: A total of 31 medical students with limited experience in laparoscopic and robotic surgery. Results: There were no statistically significant differences in the demographics or prior surgical and videogame experience between the participants in the laparoscopic and robotic arms of the study (X2 = 0.72, p = 0.75). Timed initial assessment of the RoSS Balloon Grasp (p = 0.84) and Ball Drop (p = 0.79) tasks and the LS Peg Transfer (p = 0.14) and Ball Drop (p = 0.44) tasks were not statistically different between the 2 arms. The simulator modality which was practiced yielded the greatest improvement. The degree of improvement on the unpracticed modality was not statistically different between the groups (p = 0.57), and it was not significantly better than 2 rounds of sequential practice on the practiced modality (LS, p = 0.98 and RoSS, p = 0.55). Conclusions: With practice, both groups increased surgical skill on the unpracticed modality. However, this degree of improvement was equal, suggesting there is no transferability of skills between laparoscopy and robotics. © 2019 Association of Program Directors in Surgery","laparoscopy; medical student; Patient Care; Practice-Based Learning and Improvement; resident; robotics; simulation; Systems-Based Practice","Adult; Clinical Competence; Female; Humans; Internship and Residency; Laparoscopy; Male; Motor Skills; Robotic Surgical Procedures; Simulation Training; Surveys and Questionnaires; Task Performance and Analysis; Vermont; Video Games; adult; Article; cross training; eye hand coordination; female; human; male; medical student; priority journal; residency education; robot assisted surgery; simulation training; surgical training; video game; clinical competence; controlled study; education; laparoscopy; medical education; motor performance; questionnaire; randomized controlled trial; task performance; Vermont","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85068781530"

It remains inconclusive regarding the benefits of peer observation in skills learning. Hence, we investigated whether the active engagement (AE) of peer observation in addition to expert demonstration would facilitate the performance in the virtual reality (VR) tasks. Setting/Design: The programs involved 4 VR tasks including basic (camera targeting), intermediate (energy dissection and energy switching), and advanced (suture sponge) tasks in the da Vinci Skills Simulators, which were set up in the operating room at Taipei Medical University Hospital. Fifty medical students participated in the study. The AE of the participants was defined as the total number of peer observations in addition to expert observation before their performance. We assessed the correlations between AE and surgical task performance using Pearson correlation and the concept of learning analytics. Participants: Medical students (sixth-year students in Taiwan, equivalent to fourth-year students in the US system) from Taipei Medical University were recruited. Results: AE was correlated with the energy dissection task (r = 0.329, p = 0.02) and marginally associated with the energy switching task (r = 0.271, p = 0.057). However, AE was not correlated with either task scores for camera targeting (r = 0.096, p = 0.509) or task scores for suture sponge (r = −0.091, p = 0.529). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that AE of peer observation may facilitate learning energy dissection task, which is an intermediate-level task, but not in other basic or advanced tasks in a VR context. The study highlights the potential effect of AE of peer observation on surgical learning based on a distinct level of tasks. Tasks that fit the learners’ level are recommended. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of peer observation on surgical training still has to be explored to ensure favorable results and optimal learning outcomes. © 2019 Association of Program Directors in Surgery","collaborative learning; observational learning; Patient Care; peer-assisted learning; Practice-Based Learning and Improvement; robotic surgery; surgical simulation; virtual reality","Clinical Competence; Education, Medical, Graduate; General Surgery; Peer Group; Simulation Training; Virtual Reality; Article; collaborative learning; endoscopic surgery; female; human; male; medical student; peer group; priority journal; robot assisted surgery; skill; surgical training; Taiwan; task performance; university hospital; video game; virtual reality; clinical competence; education; general surgery; medical education; procedures; simulation training","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85066104507"

Earlier the students are made aware of this, the more time they have to acquire these skills. Escape rooms have been introduced in the medical literature but a detailed published manual on setting up and running such a learning modality is lacking. The purpose of this paper is to describe the use of an escape room to create learning opportunities, including detailed instructions, as well as an evaluation from two settings. Methods: A medical escape room focusing on NTS was developed and run in two different settings: a university summer school–EMSS17, and an international healthcare congress–EMS2018. Questionnaire data investigating entertainment value, self-evaluated use of NTS and ideas for further use of the escape room concept was obtained. Further, video analyses were conducted to triangulate self-rated analyses. Results: Majority of the participants found the escape room psychologically safe and enjoyable and would recommend the concept to other students and healthcare professionals. Video analyses showed the same tendencies regarding the use of NTS as reported by participants. Conclusions: This paper presents a fully applicable escape room manual, ready to implement, adapt, and modify.

Serious games for heritage applications have received much interest, and many examples are well documented in the literature. Many frameworks and methodologies have been proposed for how to design serious games, yet there is a lack of guidance for how to embed heritage information in the mechanics and content of these games. There are also many examples of commercial (non-serious) games that contain heritage content, and there is interest in how these games can be used in educational contexts. However, these games are designed primarily for entertainment purposes, without pedagogical foundations and with limited historical accuracy. There is currently a lack of a rigorous, scientific approach to support the critical analysis of the content of these games and to inform their use within learning settings. In this paper, we propose that the above issues are related by a lack of definitions of heritage content in the video game medium. We describe a model that defines how historical information can be presented in a video game at a content level and demonstrate how it can be applied to the analysis of the content in a commercial historical game. Finally, we propose a novel methodology based on activity theory to guide the design of serious games, based on pre-defined heritage instructional content. The findings are relevant both to educators who wish to use heritage video games, and to designers of serious games for heritage. © 2018, The Author(s).","Game analysis; Game design; Serious games; Virtual heritage","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074242169"

The present study identifies the profile of adult video gamers and defines the characteristics of the games they choose to play. It also examines the way and with what type of video games adults perceive that key competences are developed. From a quantitative perspective, the questionnaire on video games and adult education (QVAD) (Alonso and Yuste, 2015) was applied to a sample of 404 subjects. The results confirmed that adult video gamer, while playing, also learns and develops key competences. Role-playing games are those most closely linked to the development of hard (technical, practical and mechanical) and soft skills (personality traits) for globalised society.

While the links between the two overarching strategies could be more significant, especially considering the social construction of disasters, the flexibility offered by both curricula to how teachers approach the subject allows for a stronger inclusion of DRR activities. While it is acknowledged that children are greatly affected by disasters, the perspectives of children are often the least heard and included in DRR. Research into the use of disaster video games as learning tools brings together the perspectives of teachers and students to consider how to foster children's participation in DRR and support the aims of the Sendai Framework.

Given the time people may spend in these worlds compared to the time they spend being trained in geoscience, we wondered whether expert geoscientists would differ from non-geoscientists in whether they judge the landscapes in these video games to be ""realistic"". Since video games present a great opportunity for tangential learning, it would be a missed opportunity if it turns out that features obviously fake to geoscientists are perceived as plausible by non-geoscientists. To satisfy our curiosity and answer this question, we conducted a survey where we asked people to judge both photos from real landscapes as well as screenshots from the recent The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild video game on how likely they thought the features in the picture were to exist in the real world. Since game world screenshots are easily identified based on their rendered, pixelated nature, we pre-processed all pictures with an artistic ""Van Gogh""filter that removed the rendered nature but retained the dominant landscape features. We found that there is a small but significant difference between geoscientists and non-geoscientists, with geoscientists being slightly better at judging which pictures are from the real world versus from the video game world. While significant, the effect is small enough to conclude that fantastical worlds in video games can be used for tangential learning on geoscientific subjects. © Author(s) 2019.","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85107907407"

When coaching games, these decisions are even more challenging due to the interactive nature of games themselves and, in team games, this interactivity is heightened. Therefore, proponents of various approaches to coaching games could do well to demonstrate how different approaches may compliment rather than oppose each other, to avoid a one-size-fits-all process of coaching. In this insights paper, we summarise some of the fundamental approaches used for coaching games, whilst clarifying and contrasting their theoretical and practical differences. In doing so, we propose that there is a space in the coach’s toolbox for a games approach that hones the metacognitive skills of players. We also suggest reasons why coaches might use metacognitive game design as a tool to develop players’ deep understanding of game play to support player learning and performance. © 2019 Human Kinetics, Inc.","deep understanding; digital video game design; meta-cognition; pedagogy","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85083552049"

They enable playful experiences and help children understand abstract concepts, but their connection with cognitive development is not totally clear. It is also not clear how virtual and physical materials influence the development of different strategies for solving instructional tasks. To shed light on these issues, we conducted a 13-day intervention with 64 children from first grade, divided into three groups: Virtual Interaction (VI), Tangible Interaction (TI), and Control Group (CO). The VI group played a fully digital version of a mathematics video game and the manipulation of the blocks took place on the tablet screen. The TI group played the same video game with digitally augmented tangible manipulatives. Finally, the CO group continued with their classroom curricular activities while we conducted the training, and only participated in the Pre and Post-Test evaluations. Our results highlighted that the use of tangible manipulatives led to a positive impact in children's mathematical abilities. Of most interest, we recorded children's actions during all the training activities, which allowed us to achieve a refined analysis of participants' operations while solving a number composition task. We explored the differences between the use of virtual and tangible manipulatives and the strategies employed. We observed that the TI group opted for a greater number of blocks in the number composition task, whereas the VI group favored solutions requiring fewer blocks. Interestingly, those children whose improvement in mathematics were greater were the ones employing a greater number of blocks. Our results suggest that tangible interactive material increases action possibilities and may also contribute to a deeper understanding of core mathematical concepts. © Copyright © 2019 Pires, González Perilli, Bakała, Fleisher, Sansone and Marichal.","additive composition; digital manipulatives; mathematics; tangible manipulatives; technology-enhanced learning activities","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85078275443"

Knowledge on the best evacuation practice is commonly delivered by traditional training approaches such as videos, posters, or evacuation drills, but they may become ineffective in terms of knowledge acquisition and retention. Serious games (SGs) are an innovative approach devoted to training and educating people in a gaming environment. Recently, increasing attention has been paid to immersive virtual reality (IVR)-based SGs for evacuation knowledge delivery and behavior assessment because they are highly engaging and promote greater cognitive learning. This paper aims to understand the development and implementation of IVR SGs in the context of building evacuation training and research, applied to various indoor emergencies such as fire and earthquake. Thus, a conceptual framework for effective design and implementation through the systematic literature review method was developed. As a result, this framework integrates critical aspects and provides connections between them, including pedagogical and behavioral impacts, gaming environment development, and outcome and participation experience measures. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Evacuation study; Serious games; Systematic literature review; Virtual reality","E-learning; Virtual reality; Building evacuation; Conceptual frameworks; Emergency evacuation; Evacuation study; Immersive virtual reality; Innovative approaches; Knowledge delivery; Systematic literature review; Serious games","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85053154433"

In the classroom, it is possible to distinguish between time spent by students on-task and off-task. The former is the time in which the student is focused on the learning task; the latter is the remaining time in which they focus on other activities. Understanding the relationship between the two is a concern for teachers, especially for those who teach mathematics and other subjects that are often considered unattractive by students. Given the opportunity afforded by educational video games to motivate and engage math students, an educational drill-and-practice video game was used in this study to practice second-grade arithmetic and study the students' on-task and off-task behavior. We found that when practicing arithmetic using an educational drill-and-practice video game, time on-task decreases during an activity (30 minutes) as well as over the course of the school year (March to December).

We tested whether learners could reproduce the eco-driving behaviour and implement the rules once they were autonomous. We also aimed to validate the method as a relevant eco-driving teaching tool that does not distract drivers or affect safety behaviour.

The participants in the research were teenagers. The analysis and interpretation of games and explanations of their pedagogical merit indicate that players recognize their value for informal learning. Latent characteristics of video games include positive elemests such as taking responsibility, teamwork, sense of belonging, creativity, multiculturalism, personal virtues and values, emotion management, learning new information and skills, motor skills development and professional orientation. In that respect, it is possible to conclude that gaming may help in the development of certain abilities important for informal as well as formal learning in today's digital age.

Design: This study used a single-site, prospective, randomized trial with 2 branches: immediate and delayed treatment. Outcome measures were obtained after a 1-month intervention and, for the immediate group only, after a 1-month retention interval. Setting: College students from the University of Iowa were recruited via mass e-mail. The intervention took place in the participants’ homes; the testing took place in a university laboratory. Participants: Forty undergraduates (32 women, 8 men) who planned to take the Graduate Record Examinations (GRE; Educational Testing Service, 2018) within the year following the treatment participated in the study. Participants were allocated to 1 of the 2 treatment branches via biased coin randomization. Intervention: The treatment consisted of vocabulary training on Vocabulary.com for a minimum of 20 min (dose) 4 times per week (frequency) for 4 weeks (treatment duration), for a total cumulative treatment intensity of 320 min. Outcome Measures: The prespecified primary outcome measures of word learning were the number of words mastered during Vocabulary.com play and the percentage of mastered words accurately defined. The depth of information included in the definitions was a secondary outcome. The prespecified primary outcome measure of functional impact was change in the verbal GRE practice test scores from pre-to posttreatment. The examiners scoring the definitions were blind to treatment assignment. All other outcomes were measured automatically by the relevant computer program so blinding was moot. Results: The participants averaged 5.33 hr of play during the treatment interval and mastered 124 words. Amount of play and mastery were highly correlated. Accuracy of definitions was 55% or 59% (depending on treatment branch) after treatment and 55% 1 month later, an insignificant decline. The game itself did not result in GRE gains, but participants who mastered more words per minute of play had higher GRE scores than other participants. Conclusion: Vocabulary.com, an evidence-based game, showed promise as a way to build vocabulary knowledge, but at the intensity of treatment provided, it did not result in gains in high-stakes test performance.

Learners tend to be wrong in writing and not show much interest in writing academic writing. One of the reasons for this is because of the conventional approach by educators that are making learners not to feel motivated to write and cause a lack of writing skills. Due to that, to motivate students to be engaged in writing, an intervention of video games is used in teaching writing for ESL learning. The use of video games, specific Players' Underground Battle, or widely known as PUBG, is used in motivating learners to write.

Even leaders in the tech industry are beginning to decry the time young people spend on smartphones and social networks. Recently, the World Health Organization proposed adding ""gaming disorder"" to its official list of diseases, defining it as a pattern of gaming behavior so severe that it takes ""precedence over other life interests"". At the same time, many others have celebrated the positive properties of video games, social media, and social networks. This paper argues that a deeper understanding of human beings is needed to design for deep learning. For the purposes of this study ""design for deep learning"" means helping people matter and find meaning in ways that make them and others healthy in mind and body, while improving the state of the world for all living things, with due respect for truth, sensation, happiness, imagination, individuality, diversity, and the future. In particular, fifteen features related to human nature are suggested based on recent scientific developments to answer the question: What is a human being? Consequently, proposals that are linked to learning and transformation, as well as social improvement, should fit with the ways in which humans, as specific sorts of biological and social creatures, learn best (or can learn at all) and can change for the better. © ISSN: 1134-3478.","Active learning; Aprendizaje activo; Aprendizaje profundo; Cambio social; Collective intelligence; Cultura participativa; Deep learning; Digital media; Inteligencia colectiva; Learning theories; Medios de comunicación sociales; Medios digitales; Participatory culture; Social change; Social media; Teorías del aprendizaje","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85057617924"

The regression analysis as a multivariate method for data processing has been used and it established the prognostic value of the group of predictive variables. In general, it can be concluded that showing emotions, responsibility and keeping promises inside a family can be linked to playing video games with non-violent contents. The results are especially important for future teachers, since they need to be able to develop appropriate strategies which prevent adverse impacts on learning abilities such as social and communication skills. © 2019 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","Aggressiveness; Emotions; Family resilience factors; Long-term desensitisation effects; University students; Video games; Violent contents","Croatia; Pula; aggression; correlation; recreational activity; regression analysis; student; violence","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85064275902"

It has also been possible to conclude the existence of some significant differences regarding gender in some aspects related to the curricular mediation of video games in which males are more inclined towards their use, as well as in regard to their personal relationship with this theme. Therefore, it can be inferred that video games can be used in the education of children at the primary stage. © NAER Journal of New Approaches in Educational Research 2019.","Learning; Primary education; Univesity student; Videogames","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85060556547"

Educational computer games can enhance learner engagement and content knowledge gain. Video games based on Malone’s theory of game design that involve challenge, fantasy, and curiosity can help improve learning. Aim. The purpose of the study is to compare differences between two drill-and-skill games to learn French phrases. Variables examined were student engagement, content knowledge gain, and demographical implications (e.g., gender, minority status, and socio-economic status). One of the games in the study meets Malone’s theory of game design. Method. This quasi-experimental study divides participants into two groups, each playing a different type of drill-and-skill game. Instruments to collect data include a pre- and post-test on French phrases and a digital game engagement questionnaire. Participants receive a short instructional session, game play time, and instruments to complete. Results. No significant results have been found in content knowledge gain and engagement between participants in the pre- and post-tests. A slight difference in relation to minority status has been discovered. Feedback from the participants show a positive response toward the games, except that some distraction and technicality have interfered with their learning. Conclusion. Although results are inconclusive, drill-and-skill computer games can be a tool to enhance learning and provide student engagement. © The Author(s) 2018.","drill-and-skill; educational computer games; engagement; learning; Malone’s theory of game design","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85047933884"

However, little is known about how creative streamers engage with their audience, how their viewership communities form and operate, and how creative streams may support learning. In this study, we used a participant-observer method to study game development streams on the live streaming site Twitch.tv. We found that live streams support the growth of learning-focused communities that mentor both the streamer and each other during and after streams.

In recent years, however, spurred on by the continued success of interactive entertainment, digital play has grown from a niche field to a promising avenue for all types of archaeological scholarship (Champion 2011; Champion 2015; Mol et al. 2017a; Morgan 2016; Reinhard 2018). Firstly, this article provides an introduction on the intersection between play and scholarship, followed by a discussion on how ‘archaeogaming’ scholarship has been shaping and been shaped by its subject matter over the last years. Secondly, the scholarship that arises from digital play is further illustrated with a case study based on the RoMeincraft project developed by the authors. The latter, made use of Minecraft, the popular digital building game, to (re-)construct and discuss Roman heritage through collaborative play between archaeologists and members of the public. Starting with in-game maps, sites such as forts, settlements, and infrastructural elements were rebuilt based on geological, archaeological, and historical information. These crowdsourced reconstructions, which not only relied on archaeological knowledge but also on a fair dose of creativity, took place in a series of educational public events in 2017–2019. The case study will detail the results of this project, as well as its methods, thus providing a practical example of digital scholarship which begins with discovery and ends in learning. The paper will conclude by reflecting on how the fun yet unpredictable dynamics of a digital playground not only shape public engagement with the past, but also open up unexpected avenues for more inclusive archaeological scholarship.

However, in technological areas such as engineering, where students must carry out hands-on exercises and laboratory work essential for their learning, it is not so easy to design online environments for practicals. The aim of this experimental study was to examine students’ acceptance of technology and the process of adopting an online learning environment incorporating web-based resources, such as virtual laboratories, interactive activities, and educational videos, and a game-based learning methodology. To this end, their responses to an online questionnaire (n = 223) were analyzed using structural equation modeling. The study was based on the technology acceptance model (TAM), but included and assessed other factors such as perceived efficiency, playfulness, and satisfaction, which are not explained by the TAM. Our results confirm that this extension of the TAM provides a useful theoretical model to help understand and explain users’ acceptance of an online learning environment incorporating virtual laboratory and practical work. Our results also indicate that efficiency, playfulness, and students’ degree of satisfaction are factors that positively influence the original TAM variables and students’ acceptance of this technology. Here, we also discuss the significant theoretical and spractical implications for educational use of these web-based resources. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Online learning environments; Online practical work; Simulations; Technology acceptance model; Virtual laboratories","Computer aided instruction; Efficiency; Engineering education; Laboratories; Students; Websites; Online learning environment; Practical works; Simulations; Technology acceptance model; Virtual laboratories; E-learning","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85062212850"

Playful competition facilitates moral learning, rewards perspective-taking skills, and challenges children to healthily regulate unpleasant emotions such as frustration, anger, and jealousy. Despite this, research on the effects of competitive video gaming has focused on antisocial outcomes, such as declines in prosocial behavior. Moreover, methodological shortcomings such as experimental studies using designs with poor generalizability, and a lack of longitudinal studies, leave open the influence of competitive gaming on social development among preadolescent children. This longitudinal study therefore investigated the relation between competitive gaming and changes in children's social development across 3 measures: conduct problems, peer relations, and prosocial behavior. At 2 timepoints, 1 year apart, 184 Dutch children (8.31-12.68 years old) reported their gaming frequency and listed their favorite games to play, and their parents reported their children's psychosocial health. Children's nominations were coded as including or not including a competitive video game. Children who nominated a competitive game at the first time point were more likely to show a decrease in conduct problems and an improvement in peer relations. No interactions were observed between competitive gaming and gaming frequency. These results encourage future research to investigate the social benefits of playful competitive gaming among peers, and for future studies to take other variables such as violent content, cooperative play, and real world competitive play into account. © 2017 American Psychological Association.","Child development; Competitive play; Gaming; Peer relations; Prosocial behavior","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85060402245"

This comprises 32 simulated experiments covering a range of physics topics, selected in collaboration with practicing school teachers. PhysLab is made available at no cost for the physics education community as an installable application, ready to run, while giving the instructor some control over how information is displayed, and suitable ranges of experimental parameters. While we focus on the theory, design and pedagogical aspects of PhysLab, we provide some critical reflections on the use of simulations in physics teaching in general, and especially how these could be most effectively used in the physics classroom. The experiments are classified according to their nature: Supporting theory; 'What if'-scenarios, like playing badminton on the Moon; or as hypothetical situations, such as what happens if you drop your home town into a hole through the centre of the Earth. It is not our intention to advocate the replacement of real practical work; we suggest various ways in which simulations can be integrated into the classroom, including instruction and real practical work. We also discuss the details of several PhysLab simulations: The Wilberforce Pendulum; oscillations of a mass on a rubber band, which involves non-linearity; the Drude theory of electrical conduction; the Cyclotron, and a 'Journey to the Centre of the Earth'. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85067232768"

Gamification projects rely on extrinsic motivators to encourage participants to engage, such as compulsory participation or real-world rewards. UniCraft incorporates an asynchronous multiplayer Battle Game that uses constructive competition to motivate students, without using motivational levers that may reduce intrinsic motivation. The novel Battle Game employed by UniCraft employs Player vs Environment (Shafer, 2012) and Player Matching (Jennings, 2014) to ensure students work together in similarly ranked small groups as a team against a shared enemy. A study was undertaken which examined students' long-term engagement with UniCraft within the context of a 12-week long undergraduate programming course. The app was initially provided with the battle feature disabled, so that the effect on motivation and engagement could be studied when it was introduced during the intervention. Detailed interaction data recorded by the app was augmented by semi-structured interviews in order to provide a richer perspective on its effect at an individual and group level. The interaction data revealed convincing evidence for the increased motivational power of the battle feature, and this was supported by the interview data. Although no direct negative effects of competition were observed, interviews revealed that cheating was prevalent and this could in turn have unintended negative side-effects on motivation. Full results are presented and case studies are described for three of the participants, giving an insight into the different styles of interaction and motivation experienced by students in this study. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Avatar; Competition; Gamification; Mobile; Video game; Virtual","Competition; Curricula; E-learning; Gamification; Human computer interaction; Motivation; Avatar; Mobile; Motivation and engagements; Negative side effects; Semi structured interviews; Undergraduate students; Video game; Virtual; Students","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85047864879"

While prior research indicates that considering alternative perspectives facilitates understanding, little is known about how media-enhanced perspectives affect learning processes for higher-order concepts that require synthesis of ideas and making inferences such as reasoning about problems in science. Two experiments used digital video of a science instructional event to investigate features of visual perspective on engagement and knowledge construction. Study 1 showed that an embodied first-person viewpoint achieved using a head-mounted camera better supported learning than a traditional third-person view of the same event. In Study 2, applying a motion algorithm to both a first-person and third-person video allowed us to isolate the effects of viewpoint and camera motion. While the addition of artificial motion benefited learning for third-person viewers, only motion that is aligned with the actor's actions and affect enhances first-person viewing. Findings are considered in terms of how certain media position learners in relation to educational content. Specifically, we argue that media features such as viewpoint and motion can be configured in ways to create ""fields of potential action"" that engage viewers and optimize conditions for learning. © 2018 Hogrefe Publishing.","digital media; learning; perspective; social cognition; video","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85047502801"

Existing video game research seemingly inhibits organic learning experiences by setting specific research targets or providing players with gameplay instructions, hence utilising methodological approaches that study the learning process from the outside. With the increasing popularity of both serious and mainstream disaster video games, a necessity exists for innovative research to explore how video games can be used as learning tools. Based upon the researchers’ own enquiry, this article demonstrates the potential use, benefits and challenges of participatory methodologies for the conduct of video game research. This article pushes back upon traditional video game research methods, reviewing the methodological approaches of existing video game literature and demonstrates how participatory methodologies are currently being used for disaster video game research. An examination of participatory methodologies, being used in disaster video game research, reviews the strengths and challenges of each research approach. Rationalising the potential of participatory methodologies, in the context of constructivist learning theory and active participation, to foster the learning process and explore learning from the inside. As such this article provides an innovative methodological framework, which can be used as a template when considering future video game research. © The Author(s) 2019.","constructivism; Disaster; disaster risk reduction; learning tools; participation; participatory methodologies; video games","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85114851709"

After his discharge from the military, Baer trained for an engineering career in electronics, radio, and television. Fascinated by television, he came to think of it as an underused technology. He believed that television owners should be able to do more than change channels and turn the set on or off—he wanted people to interact with their sets, playing games like ping pong, tennis, and checkers. In 1966, he began experimenting with ways to realize his vision. The video game industry for the home market launched in 1972 when Magnavox debuted the Odyssey game console, based on Baer's inventions.

Using a Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) approach a research model is developed to predict teachers’ behavioural intention to use educational video games in their courses. The research model is tested via structural equation modelling (SEM) on a sample of 312 Higher Education teachers. Main results suggest that perceived usefulness influences in a direct and positive way teachers’ behavioural intention while perceived ease of use indirectly influences intention through perceived usefulness. Gender and age were not found to moderate teachers’ attitude and behavioural intention. Regarding managerial implications, our findings suggest that Teacher Training Programmes aiming to encourage the use of educational video games should focus in increasing teachers’ perceived usefulness of educational video games.

Specifically, it draws attention to how games employ world building through lore—such as through item text descriptions—as well as affective game design aesthetics to create a learning experience closer in similarity to touring a museum than reading a textbook. Describing this phenomenon as the interactive museum, the article discusses how the concept operates through an analysis of the game Valiant Hearts: The Great War. The article first addresses games as teaching tools, including their potential to teach about historical wars, while paying close attention to the ethical dilemma of producing an entertaining game that also aims to teach. The design analysis begins by examining item text descriptions, lore and historical world building before describing the affective aesthetic of the interactive museum. The article concludes with a discussion on games’ potential use of tangential learning as a method to teach through interactivity. © The Author(s) 2019.","Interactive museum; learning; lore; teaching; Valiant Hearts; WWI","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85062682985"

We observed visitors playing the game and talked to them about the experience. The game explores the emergent phenomena of ant behavior. Research has shown that such emergent behavior is difficult for people to understand, and that there are different emergent schemas that work best for understanding these phenomena. We tested the visitors pre- and post-gameplay and counted the prevalence of visitors expressing direct and emergent schemas of complex processes. We then considered four hypotheses measuring changes between these schemas and found that two groups shifted their schemas. To better understand this change we provide a qualitative overview of the visitors' interactions. Our exhibit, called Ant Adaptation, takes the form of an agent-based modeling game that integrates complex system learning with gameplay. We video recorded 38 groups (114 participants) playing the game and conducted pre- and post-gameplay interviews. We coded the groups that contained children for this analysis: 9 groups (27 participants). Our results show that visitors held both emergent and direct schemas before and after play, and three people changed from direct schemas before play to emergent schemas after play. We then examine the process of how one of these groups shifted their schemas. © 2019 Vilnius University.","Ants; Complex systems; Emergent schema; Informal learning; Innovative computing education; Tools and technologies","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85065563671"

A corpus was built consisting of 297 minutes of interviews, 186 screenshots of language learning events from online sites, and 213 minutes of screencast videos of online activity. Drawing upon the conceptual framework of new literacy studies (Barton, 2007), we set four themes to present fans' literacy practices and language learning: (a) fan translation, (b) understanding the original text, (c) writing and preparing the translation, and (d) tools, resources, and collaborative online practices. Results indicated that the three informants encountered an open space for agency, creativity, and identity building and reinforcement through fan translation. Their translations provided content and represented the generators of the semiotic fabric in their fandoms (Gee, 2005). As fan translators, they learned language in multiple ways, such as peer-to-peer feedback, autodidactism, and creative uses of Google Translate.

In the first stage, we build a hidden Markov model (HMM) based on theories of customer engagement and gamer motivation to capture the evolution of gamers’ latent engagement state and state-dependent participation behavior. We then calibrate the HMM using a longitudinal data set, obtained from a major international video gaming company, that contains detailed information on 1,309 randomly sampled gamers’ playing histories over a period of 29 months comprising more than 700,000 unique game rounds. We find that high-, medium-, and low-engagement-state gamers respond differently to motivations, such as feelings of effectance and need for challenge. In the second stage, we use the results from the first stage to develop a matching algorithm that learns (infers) the gamer’s current engagement state “on the fly” and exploits that learning to match the gamer to a round to maximize game-play. Our algorithm increases gamer game-play volume and frequency by 4%–8% conservatively, leading to economically significant revenue gains for the company. © 2019 INFORMS","Customer engagement; Gamer behavior; Hidden Markov models; Online video games; Optimization","Hidden Markov models; Interactive computer graphics; Motivation; Optimization; Sales; Trellis codes; Analytic modeling; Customer engagement; Gamer behavior; Longitudinal data; Matching algorithm; Online video; Optimization techniques; State-dependent; Human computer interaction","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85079270158"

Logically, decisions made during the design and planning of a project can influence workers’ safety. The approach of considering safety in design and planning to control workplace hazards is called Prevention through Design (PtD). Many fresh graduates from architecture, construction, and civil engineering programs do not learn about PtD. Hence, the organizations which hire these graduates have to train them in the area of PtD. In most university curricula, there is no room for a new course focused on PtD. Then non-traditional approaches such as computer games and simulations can be implemented to teach PtD in universities. Computer games are routinely considered as the most important and influential medium by today's college students. The present work aims to measure the effectiveness of computer games to train and educate students for safe design thinking. Therefore, three interventions—a computer-based serious game, a paper-based game (the paper version of the serious game) and a traditional lecture—were developed and implemented to measure their pedagogical value. The serious game was found to be more effective as compared to the lecture. The paper-based game failed to motivate the students to learn. This paper discusses the possible reasons for the success and failures of these pedagogical approaches. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Construction education; Engineering education; Innovative pedagogies; Prevention through design; Serious games","Engineering education; Occupational risks; Safety engineering; Students; Civil engineering programs; Construction education; Design and planning; Games and simulation; Innovative pedagogies; Non-traditional approach; Pedagogical approach; University curricula; article; college student; education; experimental study; human; human experiment; learning; organization; pedagogics; simulation; thinking; video game; Serious games","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85061440286"

Large companies are leading in the creation of educational video games for their internal training or to enhance their public image and universities can benefit from collaborating. The aim of this research is to evaluate, both objectively and subjectively, the potential of the simulation game BugaMAP (developed by the MAPFRE Foundation) for university teaching about insurance. To this end, we have assessed both the game itself and the experience of using the game as perceived by 142 economics students from various degree plans and courses at the University of Seville during the 2017-2018 academic year. As a methodology, a checklist of gamification components is used for the objective evaluation, and an opinion questionnaire on the game experience is used for the subjective evaluation. Among the results several findings stand out. One is the high satisfaction of the students with the knowledge acquired using fun and social interaction. Another is that the role of the university professors and the company monitors turns out to be very active and necessary during the game-learning sessions. Finally, in addition to the benefits to the university of occasionally available quality games to accelerate student skills training, the company-university collaboration serves as a trial and refinement of innovative tools for game-based learning. © 2019 MDPI Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute.

Students described a sense of immediate access to history that contrasted with school-based learning, a sense of human connection to people in the past, and increased perception of multiple perspectives in history. They also evidenced a willingness to allow the games to rewrite their beliefs about history, and theorized about the games’ historical accuracy. However, students tended to miss opportunities for critical engagement with this visceral sense of immersive experience.

Design/methodology/approach: An empirical correlational study was conducted to collect the choices to seek confirmatory or critical feedback and to revise posters in a poster design task from 106 grade 8 students from a middle school in California via Posterlet. Findings: The results of the study show that critical uninformative feedback is associated with students’ performance, and critical informative feedback is associated with their learning strategies (i.e. feedback dwell time and willingness to revise), while confirmatory informative feedback is negatively associated with both performance and learning strategies. Research limitations/implications: The study controlled the choice students were given regarding the valence of their feedback but not regarding the informational value of their feedback. Additionally, the study was conducted with middle-school students, and more research is needed to ascertain whether the results generalize to other populations. Practical implications: The findings can be used to balance the design of the informational content of feedback messages to support student performance in an open-ended, creative design task. This study may also inform the design and implementation of agents (e.g. virtual characters) able to provide user-adaptive feedback for online interactive learning environments.

Similarly, utilizing programming concepts in gameplay has become popular in the videogame industry. Although many games have been developed for learning to program, their variety and their correspondence to national curricula remain an uncharted territory. Consequently, this paper has three objectives. Firstly, an investigation on the guidelines on programming education in K-12 in seven countries was performed by collecting curricula and other relevant data official from governmental and non-profit educational websites. Secondly, a review of existing acquirable games that utilize programming topics in their gameplay was conducted by searching popular game stores. Lastly, we compared the curricula and made suggestions as to which age group the identified games would be suitable. The results of this study can be useful to educators and curriculum designers who wish to gamify programming education. © 2018 British Educational Research Association.","","Educational technology; Age groups; Educational websites; Gameplay; Non-profit; Programming concepts; Programming education; Video-games; Curricula","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85053441448"

Findings revealed that game players participated in learning through collaboration, appreciation and validation, and mentoring. Moreover, affiliation, offline interests, and increased enjoyment motivated them to participate in making and sharing mods with their peers. The findings also unveiled that gaming culture has been overlooked or neglected as a form of possible applications for informal online learning, which can provide many rewarding benefits—especially to teachers, researchers, and school reformers—with a new understanding toward today's learners' multiple identity formation. © The Author(s) 2018.","gaming culture; modding; new identity formation; online ethnography; participatory learning","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85059086337"

This is often through challenging content which may take multiple attempts to complete. In education failure can also be seen as an underpinning of learning. In this study, we investigate the influence of failure on thinking skills in an educational video game. We analyze gameplay patterns and surrounding discourse of 88 middle school students playing Virulent, an educational game designed to teach virology to investigate the role of level failures in learning. Participants were separated into groups of 3–4 to roleplay as scientists and engaged in discussions on how to stop a virus while playing Virulent. To investigate the role of failure in learning in our camp, gameplay data were analyzed for patterns in player level failures while discourse around level failures was analyzed for the development of sense making. The current work presents analyses showing that a higher number of failures before initial success at levels across the game predict greater learning gains than time on task measures. This finding is then tied to discourse that shows that after encountering failures, players were often led to group discussions on relevant game mechanics with embedded virology content. This suggests that initial failures at educational game levels may help initiate collaborative discourse that promotes understanding of the program learning goals. These findings are discussed through the lens of productive failure (Kapur, 2008) and implications for educational game design are explored. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Gameplay analyses; Productive failure; Video game; Virology","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85043506864"

The current research investigates how explicit game design strategies can promote productive negativity (i.e. learning from failure), which has been identified as an important mechanism in both gaming and learning. We performed a randomized controlled trial with undergraduate biology students to investigate how game design might facilitate misconception resolution about random molecular behaviour through productive negativity. Students engaged with either a computer-based interactive simulation (n = 20) or serious game (n = 20) for 30 min, while their computer screens were recorded and click-stream data collected. We described in detail the theoretical framework underpinning our serious game and simulation using the Activity Theory Model of Serious Games (ATMSG); qualitatively coded and analysed video recordings of gameplay; and visually overlaid this data with the ATMSG models to draw conclusions about how game-design decisions influence learning-related behaviours. We found that the serious game resulted in significantly more productively negative experiences, while the interactive simulation allowed for greater exploratory or experimental behaviours. Based on our analyses of the qualitative gameplay data, we were able to recommend three game design strategies to enhance the occurrence of desired game-flow loops (e.g. productive negativity) with respect to an ATMSG framework: 1) including additional game mechanics on the primary game-flow axis of the ATMSG framework (i.e. mandatory interactions) limits the exploratory nature of the application; 2) integrating two or more primary-axis mechanics in a game-flow loop increases the frequency of interaction with this loop; and 3) gameplay loops that involve mechanics that fall off the primary-axis (i.e. non-mandatory mechanics) occur less frequently than those which involve primary-axis (i.e. mandatory) mechanics. This study is one of the first to successfully make direct comparisons between students’ interactions in a game and a non-game application to provide concrete and actionable serious game design recommendations. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Activity theory model of serious games (ATMSG); Misconceptions; Productive negativity; Randomized controlled trial; Serious game design","Activity coefficients; Computer hardware description languages; Data visualization; Design; Game theory; Mechanics; Students; Video recording; Activity Theory; Interactive simulations; Learning from failures; Misconceptions; Negative experiences; Productive negativity; Randomized controlled trial; Theoretical framework; Serious games","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85051957937"

Approach Serious games (i.e., games not intended purely for fun) are a teaching modality that have been gaining momentum as teaching tools in medical education. From May 2016 to August 2017, the authors designed and tested a serious game, called GridlockED, to provide a focused educational experience for medical trainees to learn about multipatient care and patient flow. The game allows as many as six people to play it at once. Gameplay relies on the players working collaboratively (as simulated members of a medical team) to triage, treat, and disposition ""patients"" in a manner that simulates true emergency department operations. After researching serious games, the authors developed the game through an iterative design process. Next, the game underwent preliminary peer review by experienced gamers and practicing clinicians, whose feedback the authors used to adjust the game. Attending physicians, nurses, and residents have tested GridlockED for usability, fidelity, acceptability, and applicability. Outcomes On the basis of initial testing, clinicians suggest that this game will be useful and has fidelity for teaching patient-flow concepts. Next Steps Further play testing will be needed to fully examine learning opportunities for various populations of trainees and for various media. GridlockED may also serve as a model for developing other games to teach about processes in other environments or specialties. © 2018 by the Association of American Medical Colleges.","","Adult; Curriculum; Education, Medical; Emergency Medicine; Female; Humans; Internship and Residency; Male; Video Games; Young Adult; adult; curriculum; education; emergency medicine; female; human; male; medical education; procedures; video game; young adult","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85059172739"

Prior research suggests that video games function as spaces for informal interaction. In this way, they foster spontaneous conversation that supports gameplay. Such conversation can facilitate learning. In particular, conversations that connect gameplay with the learning materials have positive effects on learning. In this article, those conversations are called situated conversations and used as an important concept to understand video games as educational tools. Aim. This study explores the conversations produced in educational activities supported by video games and the effects of these conversations on the learning of subject matter. Method. This randomized design experiment compares the conversations of a group of students using traditional text-based learning materials with the conversations of a group of students using an educational video game, during a four week intervention focused on the viral-replication process. In both conditions, spontaneous conversation among students was allowed and registered, and learning was assessed using a think-aloud task at the end of the intervention. Results. Students using the video game produced high-quality conversations focused on disciplinary content. The results show, additionally, that only conversations connecting different resources in the learning setting had a significant effect on learning, highlighting the importance of situated conversations for video game learning. Conclusions. The concept of situated conversation is proposed to characterize conversations that connect different resources available in the social environment. This type of conversation increases knowledge levels by bringing external information into the learning process. © The Author(s) 2018.","collaborative learning; conversation; peer-interaction; situated learning; video games","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85058541005"

Opportunities for librarians to learn and practice principles of gamification can be helpful for those desiring to incorporate gamification into instruction. This report describes the development and delivery of an interactive special content session at MLA ’18, the 2018 Medical Library Association annual meeting in Atlanta, Georgia, focusing on principles of low-tech game design for health sciences library classroom instruction. Case Presentation: The special content session, titled “Design, Play, Learn: A Special Content Session to Design a Game for Database Instruction,” was designed and delivered using multimodal instruction (e.g., flipped classroom, didactic component, active learning) that also incorporated principles of design thinking. A pre-and post-survey was given to all participants at the beginning and end of the session to measure confidence and desire to incorporate gamification into instruction and as a formative feedback indicator for instructors. Participants reported increased confidence and desire to use games for library instruction after participating in the session. A selection of games was uploaded to a shared content folder designed for course participants as an ongoing repository for ideas and communication. Conclusions: For librarians who are interested in incorporating principles of gamification into library instruction, attending a relatively short hands-on workshop can facilitate learning and confidence around prototyping and creating games for use in library instruction. We intend to improve upon the workshop and offer it again in additional contexts, based on direct observations of the session and participant feedback. © 2019, Medical Library Association.

In consequence of this research, it was seen that experiences, people obtain from connection with visual culture forms in their daily life, and social learning have connections. It was realized that visual culture forms supply vicarious livings to the observers prone to observe and imitate of behaviors that have model characteristic. It was seen that the livings, acquired observational learning from visual culture forms, is a shaping factor for individuals’ attitudes and actions.

As many teenagers are engaged in these kinds of practices, the big question is: How do teens learn to play video games? In most cases they do not learn to play video games at school or with their parents, and therefore it is necessary to map and analyse these informal learning strategies (ILS). The aims of this article are to identify the main ILS that teens apply as they acquire and improve their video game literacy, and to develop a series of categories for analysing and classifying these informal learning experiences. After briefly outlining the situation of ILS and teens’ transmedia skills, in the context of a general reflection on information literacy (IL) and transmedia literacy (TL), the methodological aspects of research and fieldwork in eight countries is described. A taxonomy of ILS related to video game practices is also presented. The research team identified six modalities of ILS (learning by doing, problem solving, imitation, playing, evaluation and teaching) and expanded them with four main categories (subject, time, space and relationships) that contain a series of oppositions. This set of modalities, categories and oppositions should be considered as a first step in the construction of a set of analytical tools for describing and classifying ILS in the context of teens’ video game experiences. © 2019, CILIP Information Literacy Group.

However, very few studies have concurrently examined how learners’ game-play development is influenced by cognitive, social, and situated constraints, especially over consecutive Sport Education seasons. Purpose: The purposes of this study were threefold: (i) to concurrently examine the evolution of students’ game-play participation and performance; (ii) to examine the transfer of game-play configurations across three seasons of invasion games; and (iii) to investigate how students’ game-play development was influenced by various situational constraints (e.g. nature of instruction, student engagement in instructional processes, and modifications imposed on the game forms). Participants and setting: The participants were 26 seventh-grade students (10 girls and 16 boys, mean age 12.3) from a middle school in northern Portugal. Students participated in three consecutive Sport Education seasons of basketball (19 × 45-minute lessons), handball (12 × 45-minute lessons), and football (16 × 45-minute lessons). Team membership remained the same throughout the three seasons. Two teams of five players (mean age 12.2), who played three-a-side games in every initial and final lesson of each season were sampled for game-play tracking across the three seasons. Methods: Digital video records were taken of 53 lessons. Pre-test to post-test quantitative measures were conducted on students’ game involvement (sum of total game actions) and performance (decision-making, skill-execution, and efficacy). Descriptive narratives of play were created to capture the effects of contextual circumstances on participants’ game-play behaviours and the evolution of their prototypical configurations of play. A field diary provided a chronological matrix of the principal instructional strategies and the instructional responsibility taken up by the teacher and students during the seasons. On-going student team interviews were conducted to gather learners’ perceptions of how situational constraints influenced their game-play development. Findings: The narratives of play showed a noticeable evolution in the quality of players’ game-play configurations over time. The progress in students’ ability to play invasion games was influenced by an interdependent relationship between the nature of the instructional processes used, the level of cognitive and social engagement of students with the subject matter, and specific constraints imposed on the game forms (level of defensive pressure, the dimension of the field). Conclusions: Although most research in Sport Education has shown a positive trend of student game-play development, this study revealed that the evolution of game involvement and performance is neither linear nor concurrent. Both game-play development and the transfer of tactical solutions and decision-making processes across games within the same category were critically and differentially influenced by various situational constraints. © 2019, © 2019 Association for Physical Education.","game-play; learning games; mixed-methods; Prolonged team affiliation","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85060551608"

In addition to facilitating meaningful exhibit interaction, this study examined pre- and post- creative self-efficacy scores and participant activity preferences according to creative self-efficacy scores and gender during a three-hour visit to a science museum for 37 participants, aged 9–14. Results indicated a pre-to-post improvement in creative self-efficacy with a small effect size. Activity differences between those scoring high in creative self-efficacy and those who scored low were found. No gender differences in creative self-efficacy were noted, but boys preferred the multimedia poster work while girls preferred observations of animals and physics display interactions. Results indicated that young people with higher creative self-efficacy enjoyed playing a situated mobile game more than those with lower creative self-efficacy, and that playing a situated mobile game focused on creative activity contributed to an increase in creative self-efficacy for participants. © 2019","Creative self-efficacy; Creativity; Elementary students; Gender differences; Location-Based game; Middle school students; Science center","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85068712894"

However, if teachers themselves are not motivated, or if they lack a positive attitude towards implementing these new methodologies, it will be dificult for students to feel motivated when approaching said resources. Therefore, it is important to know what teachers' attitudes towards them are. The aim of this research is the creation of an attitudes scale towards collaborative learning with video games, aimed at in-service primary school teachers. Different methodological steps were followed that made its construction possible, such as the analysis of items and the verification of their reliability, resulting in a rigorous attitudes scale of 33 items, with a reliability of α = 0.947.

We collected click-stream data, as well as eye-tracking, electroencephalography (EEG), video, and wristband data during the experiment. Our analysis shows that traditional click-stream models achieve 39% error rate in predicting learning performance (and 18% when we perform feature selection), while for fused multimodal the error drops up to 6%.

One implementation is in teaching students’ tactical understanding in games, in which it can promote students’ perceptions and shared understanding in learning tactical situations within a game-based approach. Purpose: The central aim of this study was to explore how mutual agreement and accuracy of students’ perceptions of tactical aspects of a basketball game situation and students’ perceived learning outcomes are influenced by using a debate of ideas (DI) setting that is enriched with video footage from digital tagging the foregoing game play. Participants and setting: Two groups of secondary school students (N = 20, 11–13 years) judged the tactical appropriateness of ‘shooting at the basket’ in modified basketball games during three lessons. In-between two matches, a debate of ideas session was organized. One group of students introduced video-tagged video-clips into the debate, while the second group debated without video-clips. Students’ mutual agreements in identifying and judging a shot on basket was assessed, as well as the accuracy of students’ judgements of shots during the games. In addition, students’ perceived learning outcomes were determined after each lesson. Findings: The results of the study revealed for both groups relatively low percentages of agreement among students with respect to identifying and judging a shot on basket. This shows that students perceived the situations that were debated differently. Similarly, both groups showed low accuracy in their judgements regarding the appropriateness of the shot. No group differences were revealed. However, students of the video-guided group had increased shared understanding regarding their perceived learning outcomes in comparison to students that debated without video. Conclusion: The debate of ideas in a pedagogical game-setting generated a variety of meanings about tactical situations among students, which were weakly dependent of the debate being enriched by digital video. Student-centered debates supplemented with video-clips can support teachers in promoting students’ shared understanding of tactical learning objectives of games. © 2019, © 2019 Association for Physical Education.","debate of ideas; digital observation; tagging; TGfU; video feedback","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85068220907"

The aim of this study was to compare an immersive video-assisted introduction to a minimal text-based one, with regard to emotional assessment of the situation. Methods In this pilot study, 39 students participated in a medical simulated scenario. The students were randomly assigned to an experimental group (video-assisted introduction) or a control group (minimal textual introduction) and both were followed by performing surgery on LapSim (Surgical Science, Gothenburg, Sweden). The emotional assessment of the situation, cognitive appraisal, was defined as the ratio of the demands placed by an individual's environment (primary appraisal) to that person's resources to meet the demands (secondary appraisal). Secondary outcomes were anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory), physiological parameters (heart rate, heart rate variability, skin conductance, salivary cortisol), engagement (Game Engagement Questionnaire), motivation (Intrinsic Motivation Inventory) and performance (mean score in percentage calculated by LapSim of predefined levels). Results Participants in the immersive video group (n=17) were overloaded in terms of their perceived demands (a ratio of 1.17, IQR 0.30) compared with those in the control group (a ratio of 1.00, IQR 0.42, n=22) (P=0.01). No significant differences were found between the groups in secondary outcomes. Both groups showed an increase of anxiety after the introduction method. In the experimental group, this score increased from 9.0 to 11.0, and in the textual group from 7.5 to 10.5, both P<0.01. Discussion This study shows that the method of introducing a simulated scenario may influence the emotional assessment of the situation. It may be possible to make your simulation introduction too immersive or stimulating, which may interfere with learning. Further research will be necessary to investigate the impact and usefulness of these findings on learning in simulation-based medical education. © 2019 Author(s) (or their employer(s)).

This large longitudinal violent video game study has 4 strengths. First, it is the first longitudinal study conducted with Chinese adolescents. Second, it examines moral disengagement as a possible mediating variable. Because violent video games reward immoral behaviors (e.g., stealing cars, killing characters), they might lead players to believe immoral behaviors are ""no big deal."" These moral disengagement beliefs might ""bleed over"" from the virtual world to the real world after the game is turned off, by increasing subsequent aggression. Third, it tests the hypothesis that violent video game effects are stronger for early adolescents than for late adolescents, and for males than for females. Fourth, it separates between-person effects from within-person effects. The theoretical foundation for the study is Social Cognitive Theory, which proposes that 3 interacting components determine what events result in observational learning: (a) context (i.e., violent video game exposure), (b) personal cognition (i.e., moral disengagement), and (c) behavioral outcome (i.e., aggression). Participants in this 3-wave (each wave was 6 months apart) longitudinal study were 1,340 Chinese adolescents (45.1% boys) 12- to 19-years-old (M = 14.86, SD = 1.50). Moral disengagement was a significant mediator of the longitudinal relationship between violent game exposure and aggression in the cross-lagged panel and between-person analyses, but not in the within-person analysis. As expected, effects were stronger for early adolescents than for late adolescents, especially between persons. However, gender did not moderate the effects.

A sociocultural perspective is used to show how the students use a combination of different artifacts as resources in the game design process, focusing on how students take epistemic stances and how the artifacts are given different epistemic status. The students jointly construct knowledge that they then integrate into computer games using artifacts such as textbooks, world maps, Google, and timelines.

In this study, we conduct a theory-based evaluation of 20 distinct game mechanisms in view of their potential to promote MS. MS is thereby operationalized in terms of three learning outcomes (LOs): empathic concern for relevant groups, alertness to values/principles, and awareness for one’s vulnerability to biases.

The present study explores how connecting to students’ individual interests can be used to personalize learning using an Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) for algebra. We examine the idea that the effects of personalization may be moderated by students’ depth of quantitative engagement with their out-of-school interests. We also examine whether math problems designed to draw upon students’ knowledge of their individual interests at a deep level (i.e., actual quantitative experiences) or surface level (i.e., superficial changes to problem topic) have differential effects. Results suggest that connecting math instruction to students’ out-of-school interests can be beneficial for learning in an ITS and reduces gaming the system. However, benefits may only be realized when students’ degree of quantitative engagement with their out-of-school interests matches the depth at which the personalized problems are written. Students whose quantitative engagement with their interests is minimal may benefit most when problems draw upon superficial aspects of their interest areas. Students who report significant quantitative engagement with their interests may benefit most when individual interests are deeply incorporated into the quantitative structure of math problems. We also find that problems with deeper personalization may spur positive affective states and ward off negative ones for all students. Findings suggest depth is a critical feature of personalized learning with implications for theory and AI instructional design. © 2018, International Artificial Intelligence in Education Society.","Individual interest; Intelligent tutoring systems; Personalization; Personalized learning","Algebra; Computer aided instruction; Education computing; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Critical features; Differential effect; Individual interests; Instructional designs; Intelligent tutoring system; Personalizations; Personalized learning; Quantitative structures; Students","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85061190883"

However, little is known about how phonetic learning is affected by room acoustics. This study investigated how room reverberation impacts the acquisition of novel phonetic categories during implicit training in virtual environments. Listeners were trained to distinguish a difficult nonnative dental-retroflex contrast in phonemes presented either in a fixed room (anechoic or reverberant) or in multiple anechoic and reverberant spaces typical of everyday listening. Training employed a videogame in which phonetic stimuli were paired with rewards delivered upon successful task performance, in accordance with the task-irrelevant perceptual learning paradigm. Before and after training, participants were tested using familiar and unfamiliar speech tokens, speakers, and rooms. Implicit training performed in multiple rooms induced learning, while training in a single environment did not. The multiple-room training improvement generalized to untrained rooms and tokens, but not to untrained voices. These results show that, following implicit training, nonnative listeners can overcome the detrimental effects of reverberation and that exposure to sounds in multiple reverberant environments during training enhances implicit phonetic learning rather than disrupting it. © 2019, The Author(s).","Adaptation to reverberation; Implicit learning; Perceptual learning; Phonetic learning; Speech perception","Acoustic Stimulation; Acoustics; Adolescent; Adult; Environment; Humans; Language; Learning; Male; Phonetics; Sound; Speech; Speech Perception; Video Games; Young Adult; acoustics; adolescent; adult; auditory stimulation; environment; human; language; learning; male; phonetics; physiology; procedures; psychology; sound; speech; speech perception; video game; young adult","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85061251562"

To investigate these issues, we collected data on 39 features of Tetris play for each Tetris zoid (piece), for up to 16 levels of difficulty, as each of 240 players played an hour of Tetris under laboratory conditions. Using only early (level 1) data, we conducted a Principle Component Analysis which found intriguing differences among its three, statistically significant, principle components. Each of these components captures different combinations of perception, decision-making, and action which suggests differing higher level skills, tactics, and strategies. Each component is presented and discussed, and then used in a series of principle component regression analyses on subsets of these data (a) from different Tetris levels, as well as (b) from players of different levels of expertise. We validate these models with data collected at a locally held Tetris tournament. These components represent elements of expertise; namely, correlations among perceptual, decision-making, and motor features that represent processing stages and hierarchical control and which distinguish expert from novice Tetris players. These components provide evidence for an integrated complex of processes – the Mind's Hand and the Mind's Eye – that are the essence of expertise in the real-time, sequential-decision-making task of Tetris. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Choice reaction time; Expert; Extreme expertise; Perceptual expertise; Perceptual learning; Principal Component Analysis; Sequential decision-making; Skill; Tetris; Time pressure; Video games","Adult; Decision Making; Female; Humans; Male; Perception; Psychomotor Performance; Reaction Time; Video Games; adult; decision making; female; human; male; perception; psychomotor performance; reaction time; video game","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85057981570"

Sport is an important bridge to link Physics concepts to known phenomena. Using games to learn has grown into a major focus of research over the last decade and provides a mechanism to immerse students in the study of strategic games and complex scientific concepts. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to study the interdisciplinarity among Physics and Sport, using the simulation computer game “Electric Field Hockey” when compared to traditional classroom methods. Methods: This study included 91 students: a control group (N=32), where traditional inquiry-based learning experiences were implemented and an experimental group (N=59) that plays “Electric Field Hockey”. Results: Results of this study show that games can lead to positive learning outcomes, as demonstrated by the increase in test scores from pre-to post-assessment and the student interviews. Conclusions: This study also suggests that a complementary approach, in which video games and hands-on activities are integrated, with each activity informing the other, could be a very powerful technique for supporting student scientific understanding. Further, our findings suggest that game designers should embed metacognitive activities such as reflective opportunities into educational video games in order to provide scaffolds for students and to reinforce that they are engaged in an educational learning experience. © 2019, Polytechnic Institute of Viseu.

These tools allow instructors to learn through practical exercises off the field of play, while they carry out activities in a participative context in which they can share and improve their knowledge regarding the Laws of the Game and consequently the interpretations and the considerations soccer referees throughout the world use to make decisions on the field of play. Design/methodology/approach: In this work, we assess a collaborative learning experience that took place during the annual FIFA FUTURO III courses that FIFA provided to FIFA referee technical instructors from its six confederations between 2013 and 2015, where 48 referee technical instructors selected from 211 national associations participated. These instructors constitute the elite of FIFA’s professional training and development chain. They teach other referee technical instructors who will then instruct international referees and assistant referees all over the world with the aim of achieving uniformity when applying the Laws of the Game. Findings: The course participants showed a high degree of satisfaction with respect to these materials and methods, especially regarding the possibilities they offer for organizing group discussions and for “learning by doing,” and a lack of skills in ICT management has been detected for some participants, who have shown a willingness and interest to improve their skills in this field. Research limitations/implications: The training and education of soccer referees is one of the most heterogeneous training processes in the world. This complex task is even more difficult because of the growing demand for video technology in referee decision making where successful teamwork requires a high level of communication and agreement among its members. Practical implications: With 211 associations, FIFA is one of the largest organizations in the world. In international competitions such as the FIFA World Cup, the referees’ decisions are analyzed by media, thousands of fans and millions of viewers. Preparing new professionals for match analysis, interpretation of Laws of the Game and working in a team is a priority for FIFA and the world of soccer. Originality/value: It is the first time that collaborative learning methods are used with interactive multimedia tools that facilitate collaborative work in the training environment of soccer referee instructors, international soccer referees and assistant referees. This paper establishes a basis and a reference for future research on the effectiveness of the new collaborative technologies used by FIFA for the training of international referees and assistant referees in general. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Collaborative learning; FIFA; Interactive multimedia; Learning platform; Soccer refereeing; VAR","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85063597884"

Design/methodology/approach: A didactic intervention was performed for five weeks. Two student groups were taught the same computational concepts in two ways. One group was taught by constructing a video game within science content to practice science and computing curriculum while the other group constructed appropriately designed projects to practice only the computing curriculum. Additionally, the students constructed a pretest project before the beginning of the intervention and a post-test project after its end. Results were based on quantitative and qualitative code analysis and interviews from the students. Findings: VGM within science content resulted in projects with more CT skills and also supported students to effectively apply their acquired coding skills, after the end of the intervention. Practical implications: The results of this study suggest an interdisciplinary environment, such as the VGM within science content, which can effectively support CT skills development and computing curriculum. Originality/value: Although VGM has been successfully applied to teach science content, this study explored the potential influence of this learning environment on CT skills development and coding fluency.

More specifically, the author discusses a key moment in the semester where students needed to move between university and non-university technology infrastructures in order to create multiplayer gamespaces that were accessible to their peers. In narrating this experience, the author will demonstrate how a discourse of “access” can be used to examine the oftinvisible policies, procedures, and restrictions that shape the way we compose, circulate and make visible digitally-native work. Furthermore, the author will discuss how a critical emphasis on “access” can help teachers and students better mediate the relationship between internal or university-supplied technological infrastructures and external platforms when creating interactive digital projects. The underlying motivation of this essay is not to lambaste universities for lack of institutional support nor is it to champion commercial organizations as saviors for helping teachers successfully use digital platforms in the classroom. Instead, the goal of this brief essay is to spur discussions surrounding the following questions: how might we use issues regarding access to better examine and navigate the hard-to-define boundaries that separate university-sanction technology use from non-university sanctioned technology use? How might calling students' attention to access refine the larger learning objectives for Digital Humanities or DH-related courses? © 2019, Alliance of Digital Humanities Organisations.

Virtual reality (VR) games can help students realize the importance of this by illustrating it. This article outlines a VR exercise for students to experience immersion as a parallel to how written works transport readers to their environments. The exercise offers a visual example of narrative sense of place and serves as a guide for the students’ writing. As personal narratives often suffer from a lack of sensory details, a visual reminder can help these writers reflect on how to immerse their readers. For students to fully grasp the purpose of the exercise, metacognitive practices are used to prepare them. Meta-strategic knowledge (MSK) makes students aware of what to look for in the VR game before they play it. I present an argument for the transfer of the skill of identifying the importance of sense of place to student writing through the familiar practice of playing games and the use of MSK. Wearable technologies serve as new frontiers for learning, and I believe exercises like this one using VR can reach more students, specifically visual learners and video game players. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Composition; Metacognition; Narrative; Presence; Telepresence; Virtual reality; Writing","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85052820547"

Materials and Methods: We designed the serious game, CODIFICO, as an alternative way to teach ICD-10 diagnosis coding to undergraduate medical students. To assess the pedagogical effect of the game, we used the quasiexperimental pretest-posttest design. The participants began by completing a knowledge pretest on Blackboard. After the pretest, the teacher presented the game to the students and invited them to play it for 1 week. Then, the students completed the posttest on Blackboard. We applied the Wilcoxon test to establish the difference between the pretest and posttest. We designed a questionnaire to evaluate the participants' technology acceptance toward the game. Results: Sixty-one undergraduate medical students from a large Colombian private university took part. There was no statistically significant difference between the pretest and the posttest. However, the game had some positive effects on knowledge. The game was well accepted among the participants. Conclusion: The game, CODIFICO, was useful to teach diagnosis determination, not diagnostic coding. Some of the reasons that caused this situation were insufficient attention to the pedagogical theory, excessive reliance on clinical aspects of the medical training, limited resources, and lack of experience at the medical school to design gamification strategies. © 2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2019.","Clinical coding; International Classification of Diseases; Learning; Medical education; Serious games","Adult; Colombia; Education, Medical, Undergraduate; Female; Humans; International Classification of Diseases; Learning; Male; Students, Medical; Surveys and Questionnaires; Video Games; adult; article; attention; clinical feature; coding; female; human; human experiment; ICD-10; learning; major clinical study; male; medical education; medical school; medical student; pretest posttest design; questionnaire; rank sum test; teacher; Colombia; International Classification of Diseases; learning; medical education; medical student; procedures; psychology; video game","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85072546722"

Findings: The examples reported point to hidden values embedded in the computational algorithms and opportunities for reflecting about their role, setting the stage for critical thinking and participative design sections. Originality/value: The originality of this paper relies on framing algorithms beyond their functional orientation (the current emphasis in literature), targeting critical connotations and biases that they may imply.

As conceptual points of departure, we used play theory, game studies, and the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) model of teacher's knowledge. Four ways of approaching the potential role of Rocksmith in music teacher education stand out as a result. In the discussion, we suggest that music gaming can be conceptualised as an activity that expands the reach of what can be considered as 'playful' and 'serious' in music teacher studies.

Design: A randomized controlled trial of subjects without prior arthroscopy training was conducted, with participants randomized to receive either a fixed protocol of simulation training on a triangulation simulation model (30 minutes of training for 4 consecutive days), or no training. On Days 1 and 5, all participants were evaluated on 3 simulated arthroscopic tasks by an independent observer. Variables analyzed included how many times portals were changed, the time it took to complete the tasks, and the task completion rate. Setting: Arthrex Inc., Naples, FL. Participants: Thirty-six participants (92% male, average 28 ± 5 years) with no prior arthroscopy training were randomized into 2 groups, with 17 in the training group (T) and 19 in the no-training group (NT). Results: On Day 1, there was no difference in rate of task completion between the T group and NT groups (41% versus 53%, p = 0.52). On Day 5, significantly more participants in the T group completed all tasks compared to the NT group (100% versus 63%, p = 0.008). Participants in the T group had significantly improved task completion times on Day 5 versus Day 1 (p < 0.05). Participants in the NT group had a significantly improved task completion time for Task 1 on Day 5 versus Day 1 (p = 0.037); no differences were found for Tasks 2 or 3. On Day 5, participants in the T group required significantly fewer portal changes compared to the NT group (2.35 ± 2.29 versus 6.95 ± 8.55, p = 0.039). Conclusions: Simulation training on a simple, low-cost arthroscopic triangulation training system resulted in an overall improvement in arthroscopic probing and triangulation skills within 1 week of training, with significantly decreased task completion times and increased efficiency of movement. © 2019 Association of Program Directors in Surgery","Arthroscopic Surgery; Arthroscopy; Interpersonal and Communication Skills; No-training Group; NT; Orthopaedic Surgery; Patient Care; Practice-Based Learning and Improvement; Residency Triangulation; Simulation; Surgical Simulation; T; Training Group","Adult; Arthroscopy; Clinical Competence; Computer Simulation; Education, Medical, Graduate; Female; Humans; Internship and Residency; Male; Orthopedic Procedures; Pilot Projects; Simulation Training; adult; arthroscopic surgery; arthroscopy; Article; clinical article; clinical effectiveness; controlled study; cost effectiveness analysis; female; health care cost; health care utilization; human; male; pilot study; priority journal; proof of concept; randomized controlled trial; simulation; simulation training; skill; sport; surgical technique; surgical training; triangulation; video game; clinical competence; computer simulation; education; medical education; orthopedic surgery; procedures","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85062350321"

However, there is still uncertainty as to when and how, with appropriate training, an individual's processing speed can be increased across a range of tasks without compromising accuracy. While playing action video games, individuals are required to process information at high speed, forcing the players to make instantaneous decisions and execute responses. Therefore, it seems worth investigating the possibility that the use of video games might serve as an efficient training mechanism for individuals wishing to speed up their overall perceptual reaction times (without sacrificing accuracy). Thus, the aim of the present study is to analyze the processing speed of video game players and compare it to that of non-video game players in order to determine whether these two groups display any significant differences. To this end, a questionnaire collecting data on gaming habits and so-ciodemographic data, as well as two tests that evaluate processing speed, were administered to a sample of 50 university students enrolled in different degree programmes. The scores of the two groups were then compared, and (taking into account possible experimental error) the results showed that video game players have a shorter reaction time than non-video game players and that neither of the groups made more mistakes than the other. © Facultat de Psicologia, Ciències de l'Educació i de l'Esport Blanquerna Universitat Ramon Llull","Comparative analysis; Learning transfer; Processing speed; Reaction time; Video games","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85066843184"

While their success as a learning tool has been demonstrated in technical fields, they have been little used in the arts. Plays, for example, would be excellent subjects for video games, as they are similar in terms of design and narrative. However, few video games are based on plays, and, of those that have been created, their effectiveness has yet to be proven. This material is limited due to the difficulty of the narrative change, distancing a play, which is linear-without interactivity-from a video game, in which the plot varies to allow interaction. This article details the creation of a video game as an interest-raising tool, based on the work of Lope de Vega's The Courtesy of Spain, in collaboration with the National Company of Classical Theater (CNTC). CNTC's main objective is to engage Spain's youth in classical theater, increasing their motivation and desire to learn more. This project includes an experiment in a school in Madrid with 154 students, between 9 and 11 years. The experiment indicates that a video game based on a play not only stimulates interest in young people, but also helps broader learning processes. 1932-8540 © 2018 IEEE.

Participants were 88 9- to 11-year-old boys from eight teams. We organized a three-day tournament consisting of 12 games, in which four games were played with each ball among all the teams. The balls differed only in their weight (440 g, 485 g, 540 g). The videos filmed were observed by two observers trained. The dependent variables were number of decisions, appropriate decisions, inappropriate decisions and ratio of correct to incorrect decisions, in the one-on-one situation. Participants made more decisions, and more correct (but not incorrect) decisions, when using the 440 -g rather than the regulation and 540 -g ball.

Specifically, with firearms frequently featured in videogames, including games where players are required to use firearms to succeed during gameplay, it is worth examining whether players' experience with firearms relates to their attitudes toward guns and gun policy. Utilizing the General Learning Model, this survey explores whether public policy outcomes regarding gun control and public safety are related to exposure to violent video games, first-person shooter games, and realistic gun controllers. Results show that increased exposure to first-person shooter games was related to more negative attitudes concerning gun control. In addition, more experience using realistic gun controllers was associated with negative attitudes toward gun control and greater support for the idea that greater gun availability can help guarantee public safety. Thus, video game exposure may shape the gun attitudes of young people in small but important ways. © 2016 American Psychological Association.","General Learning Model; Gun control; Policy attitudes; Video games","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85053474629"

The goal of the current study was to examine whether individual differences in initial exploration of a large-scale novel environment relate to subsequent spatial memories. A majority of studies examining spatial memory formed in large-scale spaces have constrained encoding of the environment by leading participants on pre-determined paths, thereby limiting their free exploration. We allowed participants to freely explore a large-scale, virtual environment to locate a set of objects within. We then tested their ability to navigate back to those objects as well as their ability to point to them from one another. Based on previous work suggesting gender differences in navigation strategies and spatial anxiety, we predicted that males and females would show different patterns of initial exploration and that these exploration patterns would account for gender differences in measures of spatial memory. We found that females revisited previous locations more often and showed lower rates of spreading through an area. These measures of exploration partially accounted for gender differences in efficiency in navigation and pointing accuracy to remembered locations. The results demonstrate the importance of exploration in spatial memory and provide a new perspective on gender differences in spatial cognition. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Exploration; Gender differences; Navigation; Spatial memory","Adolescent; Adult; Exploratory Behavior; Female; Humans; Male; Orientation; Photic Stimulation; Sex Characteristics; Space Perception; Spatial Memory; Spatial Navigation; Virtual Reality; Young Adult; adult; anxiety; Article; aversion; controlled study; exploratory behavior; female; foraging; human; human experiment; learning; male; normal human; priority journal; self report; sex difference; spatial learning; spatial memory; spatial orientation; video game; walking speed; young adult; adolescent; depth perception; orientation; photostimulation; physiology; procedures; sexual characteristics; spatial memory; spatial orientation; virtual reality","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85049782937"

METHODS: We conducted a group-randomized controlled trial. We recruited 328 fifth graders at an elementary school in northern Taiwan. The study took place in fall 2015 over a 7-week period. We used the generalized estimation equation (GEE) to evaluate the intervention effects on students' scores on the outcome measures. RESULTS: At posttest, the change in bullying knowledge was statistically significant for the game-only group and the game-with-debriefing group. Students in the game-with-debriefing group also showed an increase in empathy and a decrease in bullying attitude. At the follow-up test, knowledge increase remained significant for both the game-only group and the game-with-debriefing group. Game satisfaction survey indicated that 66.8% of the players said that the game was enjoyable.

The gallup blog, 2013). Traditional school cultures have come in conflict with the normal and natural ways that boys behave. As a result, boys have had alienating experiences and high levels of disengagement and lowered academic success in school due to rejection of boy culture, which includes aggressive play, competition, and violent fantasy. The purpose of this study was to explore ways in which we can re-engage boys and enhance their learning opportunities in traditional classroom settings. Boys are drawn to video games, which offer a unique environment where they can engage in learning activities. By taking seriously the indigenous knowledge of this portion of boy culture, we may identify ways in which their expertise can become useful towards common learning goals (Carr-Chellman 2007; Carr-Chellman and Savoy 2004). The current analysis represents the first of a multiphase study that uses an interpretive lens within a CHAT framework to identify relevant learning in Commercial of the Shelf (COTS) games. This phenomenological design identifies learning accounts that map to the United States Common Core State Standards. Our findings suggest that engaged learning can occur for these boys as a result of playing games. COTS games engage boys in normal and natural ways, and consequently can be relevant learning tools that educators, researchers and instructional designers might employ toward traditional learning objectives. © 2017, Association for Educational Communications and Technology.","Boy culture; Common core; COTS gaming; Engagement","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85038126946"

Researchers studying collaborative learning have indicated the importance of social interactions and social presence. However, few studies have examined the relationship of avatar social interactions with embodied social presence in a 3D game-based CVLE. Specifically, we examined avatar-mediated verbal and nonverbal interactions by autistic youth in iSocial, a game-based 3D CVLE for developing social competencies. How are avatar-mediated verbal and nonverbal social interactions related to the extent of embodied social presence? Building on prior studies on embodied social presence (ESP) theory and the verbal and nonverbal social interaction framework, this paper aims to explore the link between the combination of verbal (appropriate and inappropriate) and nonverbal (avatar proximity, orientation, joint attention and gesture) interaction patterns and experienced ESP level. We report on the results of 3 cohorts of a total of 11 youth aged from 11 to 14 who were diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder learning in 13 game activities in iSocial. The video data of the participants’ screen recordings were analyzed and coded based on the ESP theory and verbal and nonverbal social interaction framework. Through cluster analysis, the results identify distinct patterns of verbal and nonverbal interaction that are associated with different levels of embodied social presence. The findings of this study (1) shed light on the link between social interactions and embodied social presence and (2) provide a deeper understanding of how the unique spatial and visual characteristics of 3D CVLE and the design of game activities in 3D CVLE may transform collaborative learning, especially for autistic youth. © 2018 British Educational Research Association","","Cluster analysis; Computer aided instruction; Three dimensional computer graphics; Autism spectrum disorders; Avatar interaction; Collaborative learning; Collaborative virtual learning; Collaborative virtual learning environments; Interaction pattern; Joint attention; Social interactions; E-learning","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85050819649"

Unfortunately, this often means that not all concepts will be sufficiently communicated, understood, and recalled. Internet videos (e.g., Khan Academy), have made it easier for educators to curate course content online, and while the prospect of simply shifting course material out of live instructional time towards recorded online formats is tempting, it is a zero-sum game—medical students still will grapple with overwhelming volumes of information and challenging concepts. Instead, we propose that instructors make use of existing student interactions during office hours to efficiently collect information about student mental models and then use and inexpensive presentation-recording software to create short, targeted videos that disseminate recommended alterations to the presented student mental models. We developed this algorithm in a first-year medical physiology course—which can be highly conceptual and require students to go through multiple iterations of conceptual models. 92.5% of students responded “the videos enhanced their learning in physiology. Nine-three percent of students said the videos helped explain a difficult concept. However, analysis of exam scores suggested that the videos did not improve performance.

Based on the use of game mechanics, gamification aims at engaging students in their learning. However, there is not much research on the use of gamification in school settings, especially when it comes to foreign language learning; hence, we know little about to what extent this aim is actually fulfilled. This study intends to contribute to filling this research gap. Silva’s four dimensions of play–built from Henriot’s theory of play–are used as an analytical framework to study a teaching situation where a gamified application, developed for this research project, was introduced in a French-as-a-foreign-language class in a Norwegian upper secondary school. This article focuses on the students’ engagement in their learning activities and their control over the tasks. The interaction analysis of video data reveals that students are indeed showing expressions of playfulness and autonomy. The analysis also shows that the students are engaged in the activity and are voluntarily completing additional language tasks. These findings are promising for the use of gamified resources in foreign language learning classes. © 2016, © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","foreign language learning; game-based learning; Gamification; learner autonomy; playfulness","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84980378450"

The two studies address how narrative-based transmedia curricular resources can support student learning in early mathematics. The studies were designed to identify the affordances (features and advantages) of transmedia-based learning in preschool and first grade classrooms. Study 1 included a 4-week intervention, where students interacted with 16 digital learning games featuring the popular Curious George animated character, hands-on materials downloaded from a Curious George public media website, three Curious George video episodes, and books and other common classroom materials. Sixty-eight preschool children were recruited from a school serving low-income communities in the San Francisco Bay Area that took part in the intervention. Measures included rigorous assessments of mathematics ability. Other data collection included classroom observations, and interviews with participating teachers. Over the course of the intervention, children’s knowledge of mathematics increased significantly, as measured by the Test of Early Mathematics Ability. Results of qualitative data analysis suggest that the transmedia aspect of the intervention brought affordances to students’ learning experiences. Study 2 involved an intervention with first grade students that included narrative-based digital and non-digital learning resources from the popular Odd Squad public television series. During the study, participating students used a school-based intervention that included videos, online games, interstitials, and hands-on activities from an Odd Squad transmedia suite. Four first grade teachers from the San Francisco Bay Area and their classrooms (n = 83 first grade students and their families) participated in the study. Measures included verbal and written assessments of mathematics ability. Other data collection included interviews with participating teachers and parents. Over the course of the Odd Squad intervention, students’ overall knowledge of mathematics in the domains of Number and Operations and Algebraic Thinking increased significantly, as well as their competency with mathematics vocabulary and the concept of fact families. Results of qualitative data analysis of teacher and parent interview data suggest that the transmedia aspect of the intervention brought affordances to first grade students’ learning experiences, including an engaging narrative domain to spur student motivation, presentation of content across multiple modalities, and supportive game-based learning. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.","Digital media; Early education; Early mathematics; Game-based learning; Transmedia","Data acquisition; Data handling; Digital storage; E-learning; Information analysis; Teaching; Digital learning games; Digital learning resources; Game-based Learning; Learning experiences; Low-income communities; Multiple modalities; Qualitative data analysis; Transmedia; Students","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85048631129"

A sample of 125 undergraduate university students which played an educational video game and were assessed on Immersion, subjective System Usability, Creative Imagination, and learning performance. Immersion and System Usability were shown to be associated with higher learning outcomes, but, after controlling for other factors, it seems that System Usability is only helpful inasmuch as it promotes Immersion.

This pilot study pre-sents the BacToMars videogame and accompanying curricular intervention, de-signed to introduce children (aged 7-11) to foundational concepts of bioengi-neering and to the interdisciplinary nature of scientific endeavors. Background This pilot study explores the bioengineering-related learning outcomes and atti-tudes of children after engaging with the BacToMars game and curriculum in-tervention. Methodology This study drew on prior findings in game-based learning and applied them to a videogame designed to connect microbiology with Constructionist microworlds. An experimental comparison showed the learning and engagement affordances of integrating this videogame into a mixed-media bioengineering curriculum. Elementary-aged children (N = 17) participated in a 9-hour learning interven-tion, with one group of n = 8 children receiving the BacToMars videogame and the other group (n = 9) receiving traditional learning activities on the same con-tent. Pre- and post-surveys and interview data were collected from both groups. Contribution This paper contributes to education research on children's ability to meaningful-ly engage with abstract concepts at the intersection of science and engineering through bioengineering education, and to design research on developing educa-tional technology for introducing bioengineering content to elementary school children. Findings Children in both groups showed improved knowledge and attitudes related to bioengineering. Children who used BacToMars showed slightly stronger per-formance on game-specific concepts, while children in the control condition showed slightly higher generalized knowledge of bioengineering concepts. Recommendations for Practitioners Practitioners should consider bioengineering as a domain for meaningful, inter-disciplinary learning in elementary education. Recommendation for Researchers Design researchers should develop playful ways to introduce bioengineering concepts accurately and to engage children's imaginations and problem-solving skills. Education researchers should further investigate developmentally appro-priate ways to introduce bioengineering in elementary education. Impact on Society BacToMars introduces a meaningful scenario to contextualize complex con-cepts at the intersection of science and engineering, and to engage children in real-world, interdisciplinary problem solving. Future Research Future research should explore BacToMars and bioengineering curricula for elementary-aged children in larger samples, with longer intervention times. © 2018.","Biological engineering; Elementary school; Videogames","Curricula; Human computer interaction; Problem solving; Bioengineering curricula; Bioengineering education; Biological engineering; Elementary schools; Experimental comparison; Interdisciplinary learning; Science and engineering; Video game; Engineering education","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85047864545"

Our present experiments demonstrate the efficacy of such training using a first-person perspective movement videogame-based platform in samples of students and Soldiers. Effectiveness was assessed by manipulating KR during a training phase and withdrawing it in a subsequent transfer phase. Relative to a no KR control condition, KR systematically improved performance for both Soldiers and students. These results build upon our previous findings that demonstrated that a video game-based platform can be used to create a movement-centred sustained attention task with important elements of traditional vigilance. The results indicate that KR effects in sustained attention extend to a first person perspective movement based paradigm, and that these effects occur in professional military as well as a more general population. Such sustained attention training can save lives and the present findings demonstrate one particular avenue to achieve this goal.

A descriptive qualitative research design was used to elicit students' reflections of their experiences. Educational content such as handouts, videos, activities, and recommended resources for a required junior level nursing research course was organized into quests for use in 3D GameLab©. At the end of the semester, students were invited to give their feedback through a survey with open-ended questions. Thematic analysis resulted in the following components of the game-based learning experience: navigation, motivation, gaming concept, knowledge, technology, and target population.

These instruments help develop twenty-first-century skills, such as creativity, from a dual perspective: (i) the students’ perspective, since they develop skills and competencies that allow them to find innovative solutions to the challenges posed by games, and to become digital culture producers; and (ii) the education professionals’ perspective, to use these instruments in schools and thereby change the way students learn. Using a sample of 85 first-year secondary school students, this study aims to provide empirical evidence about the development of creativity through the introduction of video games in the classroom. To do this, an eight-week pedagogical workshop was developed in which the Minecraft video game was introduced in the subject of technology. To assess the results of the workshop, the participants’ creativity was analysed using a pre-test/post-test design through the CREA Creative Intelligence Test, as well as the evaluation of the students’ machinima productions by their teachers. Results show a significant increase in creativity and high scores for machinima productions, highlighting the opportunity to introduce these tools in classrooms in order to develop innovative educational contexts where creative processes and products are the protagonists. © 2018, © 2018 Association for Information Technology in Teacher Education.","creativity; machinima; Minecraft; secondary education; Video games","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85057326580"

Methods: Twenty-two people with DMD were evaluated and divided into two groups. The goal was to reach out and touch a red cube. Group A began with the real task and had to touch a real object, and Group B began with the virtual task and had to reach a virtual object using the Kinect system. Results: ANOVA showed that all participants decreased the movement time from the first (M = 973 ms) to the last block of acquisition (M = 783 ms) in both virtual and real tasks and motor learning could be inferred by the short-term retention and transfer task (with increasing distance of the target). However, the evaluation of task performance demonstrated that the virtual task provided an inferior performance when compared to the real task in all phases of the study, and there was no effect for sequence. Conclusions: Both virtual and real tasks promoted improvement of performance in the acquisition phase, short-term retention, and transfer. However, there was no transference of learning between environments. In conclusion, it is recommended that the use of virtual environments for individuals with DMD needs to be considered carefully. © Copyright 2018, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2018.","Duchenne muscular dystrophy; Virtual reality game","Adolescent; Analysis of Variance; Brazil; Child; Cross-Over Studies; Humans; Male; Motor Skills; Muscular Dystrophy, Duchenne; Task Performance and Analysis; Transfer (Psychology); User-Computer Interface; Video Games; Virtual Reality; Young Adult; adolescent; analysis of variance; Brazil; child; computer interface; controlled study; crossover procedure; Duchenne muscular dystrophy; human; male; motor performance; physiology; psychology; randomized controlled trial; standards; task performance; transfer of learning; trends; video game; virtual reality; young adult","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85045379157"

Model matching explains and predicts individuals’ outcomes related to gameplay by focusing on the interrelationships among games’ systems of mechanics, relevant situations external to the game, and players’ mental models. Formalizing model matching theory in this way provides researchers a unified explanation for game-based learning, game performance, and related gameplay outcomes while also providing a theory-based direction for advancing the study of games more broadly. The propositions explicated in this article are intended to serve as the primary tenets of model matching theory.

There has, however, been little consideration of the “digital age of learning” and the global success of the digital video game industry. Using the educational work of James Gee, this article attempts to rationalize how a “digital video games approach” differs from other learner-centered pedagogies currently employed for teaching and coaching games. Examination of the literature suggests that the learning gains from Teaching Games for Understanding and the Constraints Led Approach ignore the meta-cognitive dimension of learning how to play games—surely an important consideration for long-term development. Accordingly, by drawing on experiences from digital video game design, we examine how games practitioners might utilize such an approach for meta-cognition in coaching or teaching practice to stimulate player learning. © 2018, © 2018 National Association for Kinesiology in Higher Education (NAKHE).","Games; pedagogy; skill","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85038404155"

Earlier interactive response system uses infrared or radio frequency (RF) wireless communication technologies to transmit the students’ answer to teachers’ managerment system, where there exists high cost, inconvenient usage, difficult deployment. How to use IoT to improve the quality of higher education becomes a very important topic in the researh area of teaching. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is one of key technologies to implement IoT applications, and most of universities use the High Frequency (HF) RFID card as the students’ identification devices in China. In this paper, a kind of WiFi supported RFID reader (WiRF) is implemented using open source hardware platforms, such as Node MCU and RFID-RC522. Then the proposed WiRF system is used to assist teacher to perform automatic attendance record and students’ behavior record. In addition, Quick Response (QR) code is another technology to enable IoT. In this paper, QR code is designed to quickly access course video and perform real-time interactive response in the classroom, which will provide multidimensional learning and strengthen the motivation of students’ learning.

This is despite heterogeneous learning outcomes ensuing for students, owing to their different learning styles. Accordingly, we examine the relationship between teaching methodologies and learning styles. Drawing on the Herrmann Brain Dominance Instrument and the theory of ‘whole-brain’ teaching, we find a suite of teaching methodologies that are generic across learning styles–tutorials, group work, firm-oriented case studies, game playing, reading journal papers, handouts, PowerPoint slides, in-class examples, in-class short exercises, and videos–and find a group of teaching methodologies–lectures, seminars, people-oriented case studies, creative problem-solving, reading textbooks, guest speakers, in-class small group exercises, homework, role-play, problem-based learning, self-directed learning, project-based learning, and class debates–that target and develop specific learning styles. Implications of the ‘whole-brain’ model for teaching and learning are discussed. © 2016 Society for Research into Higher Education.","brain dominance model; Herrmann; learning styles; teaching methodologies; undergraduate teaching","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84959041901"

A secondary goal is to determine the effects, if any, of the classroom aspects of the FGBL strategy on learning efficiency. Our experiments involved 2 commercial games featuring physical motion concepts: Ballance (Newton's law of motion) and Angry Birds (mechanical energy conservation). We randomly assigned 87 8th-grade students to game instruction (digital game before class and lecture-based instruction in class), FGBL strategy (digital game before class and cooperative learning in the form of group discussion and practice in class), or lecture-based instruction groups (no gameplay). Results indicate that the digital games exerted a positive effect on preclass learning outcomes and that FGBL-strategy students achieved better overall learning outcomes than their lecture-based peers. Our observation of similar overall outcomes between the cooperative learning and lecture-based groups suggests a need to provide additional teaching materials or technical support when introducing video games to cooperative classroom learning activities. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","flipped classroom; game-based learning; science learning; secondary education","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85046684177"

French teacher teach geography and history. Consequently, in order to effectively train future primary school teachers, the authors have developed a course based on experiential geography (Kold, 1984). At the beginning of the course, students' cognitive representations regarding geography were analysed, and their teaching practices were also video recorded. Following this, the entire course is organized around a field trip or simulation games. This paper demonstrates how this experiential training approach is both highly efficient in improving students' knowledge and skills in geography, and a very good way to change their representations of geography. © All rights reserved.","Experiential learning; Geography teaching; Teacher training","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85056258734"

The purpose of this paper is to determine whether students would perceive the gamification activities in a positive light. Previous research has contended that students need a positive mental attitude for effective learning. The core question was to examine student attitudes to gamification, not the success of the gamification itself. Design/methodology/approach: Based on a survey of the gamification literature, and particularly drawing on the work of Groh (2012), this system is designed with three key principles in mind: relatedness, competence and autonomy. Classroom activities and associated software were designed and implemented. Almost 200 students were surveyed to determine their attitude to the gamification. The survey included both Likert-scale and qualitative responses. Findings: A majority of the students reported that they found the gamification useful and enjoyable, only a minority of students (around 15 per cent) disagreeing with such statements. However, only a minority of students perceived a relationship between the gamification activities and games. The authors conclude that well-designed gamification systems can be well-received by students and suggest that the success of gamification projects may not lie in their ability to recreate the experience of a video game, but in the strength of the relatedness, competence and autonomy of the student experience. Research limitations/implications: The research is limited by the nature of the participants, who were drawn from videogame and media units and who may be predisposed to game-like activities. Originality/value: This research demonstrates that students are able to perceive value in gamification in the classroom. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Game design; Gamification; Pedagogy; Student engagement; Student motivation; University teaching","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85044236050"

There is a need to develop new possibilities for learning this crucial competence area. In addition, educators need to be future oriented; they need to be able to design and adopt new pedagogical innovations. The purpose of the study is to describe the development process and to generate principles for the design of nursing simulation games. Method A design-based research methodology is applied in this study. Iterative cycles of analysis, design, development, testing and refinement were conducted via collaboration among researchers, educators, students, and game designers. Results The study facilitated the generation of reusable design principles for simulation games to guide future designers when designing and developing simulation games for learning clinical reasoning. Conclusion This study makes a major contribution to research on simulation game development in the field of nursing education. The results of this study provide important insights into the significance of involving nurse educators in the design and development process of educational simulation games for the purpose of nursing education. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Clinical reasoning; Design principles; Design-based research; Game design; Nursing education; Simulation game","Clinical Competence; Education, Nursing; Humans; Learning; Nursing Education Research; Problem Solving; Research Design; Simulation Training; Students, Nursing; Thinking; User-Computer Interface; Video Games; human; human experiment; learning; nursing education; scientist; simulation; student; clinical competence; computer interface; learning; methodology; nursing education; nursing student; problem solving; simulation training; thinking; video game","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85032359904"

A number of experiments and user tests were administered in order to improve understanding of how the game educates its users and improves their skill levels when playing an electric guitar. The type of experience the users expected and experienced within the Rocksmith game was also investigated.

By focusing on the learning effort, this system can easily and quickly determine whether learners have exerted the minimum effort required for learning. To do this, the system automatically generates a word game and determines whether minimum learning has taken place through the results of the word game. To verify the minimum learning judgment system, we conducted a comparative experiment on the importance of high-frequency words, a word count verification test for word games, and a judgment criteria verification test based on the length of a video lecture. Results of the experiments show that high-frequency words can be used as a feature to determine minimum learning. The appropriate number of words in the word game for the minimum learning judgment was found to be seven, and the results showed that the video length did not affect the minimum learning criteria. In addition, the minimum learning judgment accuracy result was 82%. This is not considered very high judgment accuracy, but the accuracy of the judgment is positive considering the aim of this study. © The Author(s) 2017.","e-assessment; game-based learning; gamification; mind wandering","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85053633469"

Objectives To assess nursing students’ perceptions of a video-based SG in terms of face, content, and construct validity. In addition, the study assessed perceptions of usability, individual factors, and preferences regarding future use. Design A pilot study was conducted. Setting and Participants An SG prototype was implemented as part of two simulation courses in nursing education: one for home health care and one for hospital medical-surgical wards. The SG aimed to teach clinical reasoning and decision-making skills to nursing students caring for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. A total of 249 second-year nursing students participated in pilot testing of the SG. Method A paper-based survey was used to assess students’ perceptions of the SG's educational value. Results Overall, students from both simulation courses perceived the SG as educationally valuable and easy to use. No significant differences were found in perceptions of educational value between nursing students with previous healthcare experience versus those with none. However, significantly more students in the home healthcare simulation course indicated that the SG tested their clinical reasoning and decision-making skills. Students from both the medical-surgical and home healthcare simulation courses suggested that more video-based SGs should be developed and used in nursing education. Conclusions Overall, the survey results indicate that the participants perceived the SG as educationally valuable, and that the SG has potential as an educational tool in nursing education, especially in caring for patients with chronic diseases and in home healthcare simulation. Showing a SG's educational value and user acceptance among nursing students may justify the development and application of more SGs in nursing education. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Clinical decision-making; Computer simulation; E-learning; Games; Health care; Survey; Validation","Clinical Competence; Computer Simulation; Education, Nursing; Female; Humans; Learning; Male; Nursing Education Research; Pilot Projects; Problem Solving; Students, Nursing; Surveys and Questionnaires; Video Games; Young Adult; clinical competence; computer simulation; female; human; learning; male; nursing education; nursing student; pilot study; problem solving; psychology; questionnaire; utilization; video game; young adult","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85039858184"

Children organise their participation as they communicate with and support one another, through sharing knowledge and problem-solving strategies, displaying their expertise, encouraging others and creatively exploring possibilities for collaborative game moves. Drawing on a social interactional perspective, we explore the situated and embodied practices of the young players aged 3–8 years. We present three video ethnographic case studies of young children's everyday peer interactions from three different settings and age groups: Australia (home), Norway (pre-school) and Sweden (afterschool). Across these settings, the findings identify how children collaborate with one another to progress the game by using multiple strategies, including instructing each other, monitoring each other's actions and problem solving. In the process, collaborative peer culture was maintained and built as the players worked towards problem solutions that require taking each other's perspectives, and sharing digital devices and skills. This focus on children's situated language use and assemblage of multimodal resources shows their moment-by-moment collaborative action. These multimodal interactions create opportunities for peer and sibling learning without the presence of an adult. The collaborative activity was a strategic resource used by the children in their digital game playing. In capturing young children's own strategies, we highlight their agency in learning occurring through social interaction and gameplay. © 2018 British Educational Research Association","","Digital devices; Interactive computer graphics; Collaborative activities; Collaborative games; Multi-Modal Interactions; Problem solutions; Sharing knowledge; Social activities; Social interactions; Strategic resource; Problem solving","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85053199177"

However, their use in schools is still far from mainstream practice, which could be because of the barriers such as the price of video games, schools’ technological infrastructures and teachers’ attitudes. This article focuses on pre-service primary school teachers’ attitudes (future primary school teachers currently studying at university) towards collaborative learning with video games, which employs video games in collaborative learning activities. Because playing video games is a common form of entertainment for higher education students, we investigate whether pre-service teachers’ attitudes are influenced by their experience of playing video games (taking into account the number of years they have played video games), the frequency at which they play video games and their gender. This study takes a quantitative approach, using a questionnaire with a 5-point Likert attitude scale. The results indicate that pre-service primary teachers have a positive attitude towards collaborative learning with video games. Furthermore, students who have played video games for more years, who play more frequently and the male students have more positive attitudes to using video games in collaborative learning activities. Overall, pre-service teachers have positive attitudes towards collaborative learning with video games, which could affect the use of these resources in educational practices. As the main characters in the educational process, both teachers and children need to be comfortable with new practices to achieve the objective of the educational system, which is the complete formation of children. © 2017, The Author(s).","Collaborative learning; Game-based learning; Higher education; Pre-service teachers’ attitudes; Primary education; Video games","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85018974382"

Based on a combination of video-ethnography, focus groups, field notes and digital progression log data, the analysis of a pilot study of the pedagogical intervention challenges and extends theoretical and methodological perspectives on what it means to undertake an intervention study in this context. The aim is to discuss what a mixed-methods research approach may provide for the understanding of intervention methodology by illustrating how different types of data provide understandings of how and to what extent the intervention components are functional in the pedagogical setting. The conclusion the analysis supports is that unless children’s and preschool teachers’ meaning making of the unfolding actions in the digital interface make them engage in the activity and dynamically fits within the institutional preschool system, the intervention will not be functional. A pilot study can provide detailed understandings of why, how and in what contexts interventions as part of the dynamic preschool systems can be implemented with adherence and fidelity. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

This study seeks to (a) understand how teachers use PD resources (e.g., technology personnel and game-use workshops) for integration; (b) determine how teachers integrate games into their instruction; and (c) examine how those teaching practices are associated with student achievement. This mixed method study used survey and interview responses from elementary school teachers (n = 863) with access to PD resources for implementing a math game intervention and standardized math-test scores from their second- through sixth-grade students (n = 10,715). Findings showed few teachers sought PD assistance for integration, but many desired such support. Some reported using integrative practices (i.e., referencing game and using game-generated progress reports) to identify struggling students, whereas several found integration challenging. Teachers' reordering of game objectives to align with lessons and viewing of game-based PD videos were associated with increased student math achievement in our OLS-analysis.

It requires in part that students be able to empathize with people whose ethno-cultural, economic, political, and/or geographic backgrounds are different from their own—a quality that we are labeling global empathy. Yet colleges and universities frequently find it difficult to develop global empathy among their students. We conducted an experiment to investigate whether different instructional techniques—traditional lecture, video news reports, and an online game—or undergraduate students’ academic majors are associated with variations in indicators of global empathy. Statistically significant variations in survey data were found only among students majoring in psychology and in responses to two survey questions. Two behavioral measures did not reveal any statistically significant variation. A larger sample, longer exposure to treatment condition, or other changes to the experimental design might elucidate stronger evidence that instructional method or undergraduate academic major affects the development of global empathy, but this type of research may not be feasible at colleges and universities where enrollments are small and faculty lack necessary resources. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Active learning; assessment; diversity; randomized experiment; small-n studies","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85040987692"

Educational researchers, instructional designers, and educators have sought and developed ways to incorporate video games or gamelike elements into a curriculum. We present a study of a web-based college-level introductory astronomy class in which content is delivered entirely in a digital world setting through nonplayer characters and built-in minigames. Based on prior research on the potential benefits of video games for use in education, we expect that topics covered in the minigames, the most gamified aspects of the course, should be particularly effective. Using data collected through pre- and post-testing of two sections of ASTRO 001V (the designation given in Penn State's course catalog) with the Test Of Astronomy Standards, we focused our analysis on six questions that pertain directly to minigame topics. We found that two of these questions showed encouraging gains, while the other four demonstrated that students continued to hold on to common alternate conceptions within those topic areas. This finding suggests that more work is required to understand how to improve the games in ways that will further support student astronomy learning. © 2018 authors.

We demonstrate here, however, that it acts as a conditioned stimulus to positively or negatively influence valuation, dependent on reward expectation and cognitive engagement. When subjects are asked to choose between two simulated slot machines, near-misses increase valuation of machines with a low payout rate, whereas they decrease valuation of high payout machines. This contextual effect impairs decisions and persists regardless of manipulations to outcome feedback or financial incentive provided for good performance. It is consistent with proposals that near-misses cause frustration when wins are expected, and we propose that it increases choice stochasticity and overrides avoidance of low-valued options. Intriguingly, the near-miss effect disappears when subjects are required to explicitly value machines by placing bets, rather than choosing between them. We propose that this task increases cognitive engagement and recruits participation of brain regions involved in cognitive processing, causing inhibition of otherwise dominant systems of decision-making. Our results reveal that only implicit, rather than explicit strategies of decision-making are affected by near-misses, and that the brain can fluidly shift between these strategies according to task demands. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Arousal; Expectation; Gambling; Near-miss; Reinforcement learning","Adult; Behavior, Addictive; Choice Behavior; Female; Frustration; Gambling; Humans; Male; Motivation; Reinforcement (Psychology); Reward; Video Games; Young Adult; adult; arousal; article; avoidance behavior; brain region; decision making; expectation; female; frustration; gambling; human; human experiment; machine; male; reinforcement; reward; simulation; stimulus; stochastic model; addiction; gambling; motivation; psychology; reward; video game; young adult","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85042713670"

The present study aims to summarize quantitative results from digital Game-Based Learning (GBL) strategies, through a Systematic Review of Literature with Meta-analysis study, framing conclusions about the effectiveness of the use of videogames as a learning strategy in several contexts. Through a systematic search in scientific databases and researchers’ social networks (Ebsco, ACM, PubMed and ResearchGate), 68 papers were obtained. A screening process, based on inclusion criteria, such as the use of Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs), digital GBL strategies and measures to evaluate concrete learning gains, resulted in a final sample of 14 experimental studies. Data was gathered and analyzed using two different matrices, and softwares (SPSS and CMA). Considering a joint sample of 1685 subjects, it is possible to mention that digital GBL strategies have shown larger effect-sizes than traditional approaches, namely expository, allowing larger and more effective learning outcomes.

Building on video data from one 6th grade class and one 7th grade class designing computer games based on their social studies curriculum, this article shows that tensions arise when students fail to agree on what the activity they are doing is really about: The academic content and what students commonly perceive as school activities, or a game design activity informed by their leisure time. The main argument is that the students position themselves as students, game designers or characters, and that this may cause tensions in the students’ social interactions. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","activity frames; Classroom game design; game-based learning; stancetaking","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85041136384"

This research work defines the consumption, creation and dissemination patterns of online audiovisual content young students of Guipuzcoa have acquired in the fields of leisure and complementary information resources for school use, attending to three different variables: gender, grade (age) and type of educational institution (public or private). The research methodology focuses on a self-administered questionnaire filled out by 2,426 adolescents of secondary school (12 to 16 years old). The sample consists of a random selection of 120 student groups, which are distributed in 60 schools and 30 groups each course. The results verify the existence of monolithic and opposed male/female patterns in the way young people consume, create and diffuse leisure content. Video games are the central backbone of male consumption and creation, as long as girls prefer to take pictures and videos of themselves using smar tphones and to share them on social networks. These practices repeat gender stereotypes, transforming the education in equality into a relevant issue. Finally, sources of information that are complementary to formal education, especially Wikipedia, are the main references among adolescents. Consequently, it seems essential to guarantee their solvency for appropriate knowledge acquisition. © ISSN.; Los adolescentes viven inmersos en un universo virtual en el que han construido un modelo propio de entretenimiento, aprendizaje y comunicación.

La metodología partió del diseño de un cuestionario autorrellenable que cumplimentaron 2.426 adolescentes (de 12 a 16 años), estudiantes de los cuatro cursos de ESO. La muestra es una selección aleatoria de 60 centros de Guipúzcoa y un total de 120 grupos, 30 por cada curso. Los resultados corroboran que los patrones de consumo, creación y difusión de contenidos de ocio masculinos y femeninos son monolíticos y opuestos entre sí. Los videojuegos son el eje vertebrador del consumo y creación masculino, mientras que la toma y difusión de fotografías y vídeos de sí mismas es el de las chicas. Estas prácticas repiten los estereotipos de género, por lo que la formación en igualdad se perfila como un aspecto relevante. Por último, las fuentes de información complementarias a la educación reglada, principalmente Wiki - pedia, se imponen como referencia entre los adolescentes, por lo que es imprescindible garantizar su solvencia para una adecuada adquisición de conocimientos. © ISSN.","Adolescentes; Adolescents; Audiovisual content; Audiovisual creation; Contenidos audiovisuales; Creación audiovisual; Mobile phone; Patrón de uso; Redes sociales; Social networks; Teléfono móvil; Use pattern; Video game; Videojuego; YouTube; YouTube","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85053806644"

Students who had previously expressed reluctance with reading and dissatisfaction with school experiences used their gaming skills to re-create scenes, respond to textual elements, and actualize authentic textual interactions. Inspired by the injustice of certain students being denied experiential learning in academic communities based on underperforming scores on standardized tests, this article challenges scripted, conventional curricula and suggests all students have the right to personalized relationships with literature. One student who had previously experienced feelings of failure in literacy settings expressed a newfound interest in texts when given the opportunity to enact literacy practices in academic spaces that mirrored his meaning-making in social spaces. This article promotes equity by arguing that engaging students with literature should involve an inclusive approach to curriculum and instruction. As educators we must offer high-interest readings while also providing numerous entry points into those readings for students who may not excel in homogenous environments. Social justice means celebrating students’ diverse literacy practices and leveraging those skills toward achievement, all the while empowering new voices and facilitating new discoveries. © 2018, Copyright © 2018 by the National Association for Multicultural Education.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85062424751"

However, little is known about what collaboration looks like in Minecraft, including what factors support and undermine high quality collaboration. The current exploratory study investigated this question through an analysis of middle school students' collaborative processes while playing Minecraft in small groups of 2-4 players. Analyses of the discourse functions used by players during gameplay revealed a number of factors affecting the success of their collaboration, such as prior social ties, gaming experience, and responsiveness to other players. The findings contribute new insight into the nature of more and less effective collaborations in multiplayer video games. These insights will be useful to educators who are interested in using Minecraft and other multiplayer games to promote collaboration among their students.

This study examined exposure to a socially contingent touch-screen gaming app, which replied immediately, reliably, and accurately to children's actions. Children's recall of nutritional content and their liking of the character were assessed. Materials and Methods: Four- and five-year-old children (N = 114) received no-exposure, single-exposure, or repeated-exposure to a character-based iPad app rewarding healthy and penalizing unhealthy behaviors. Children reported how much they liked the character and recalled healthy and unhealthy items from the app. An ordinary least squares regression was conducted on how much children liked the character by condition. Poisson regressions were conducted on the number of items recalled by condition alone, and in an interacted model of treatment condition by liking the character. Results: Children liked the character more in the repeated app-exposure condition than in the control group (P = 0.018). Children in the repeated and single app-exposure conditions recalled more healthy (P < 0.001) and unhealthy (P < 0.001) items than the control group. Within treatment conditions, liking the character increased recall of healthy items in the single app-exposure compared to the repeated app-exposure condition (P = 0.005). Conclusions: Results revealed that repeated exposure increased children's learning of nutritional information and liking of the character. The results contribute to our understanding of how to deliver effective nutrition information to young children in a new venue, a gaming app. © Copyright 2018, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2018.","Apps; Food marketing; Media characters; Nutrition; Obesity; Young children","Child, Preschool; Computers, Handheld; Female; Food Preferences; Humans; Learning; Male; Mobile Applications; Nutritional Physiological Phenomena; Pediatric Obesity; United States; Video Games; childhood obesity; diet therapy; female; food preference; human; learning; male; mobile application; nutrition; personal digital assistant; physiology; preschool child; psychology; standards; United States; video game","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85045408540"

The pace of technical skills acquisition varies between residents and may necessitate more time than that allotted by residency training before reaching competence. Identifying applicants with superior innate technical abilities might shorten learning curves and the time to reach competence. The objective of this study is to identify new tools that could predict surgical performance of novices on a mammoplasty simulator. Method: We recruited 14 medical students and recorded their performance in 2 skill-games: Mikado and Perplexus Epic, and in 2 video games: Star War Racer (Sony Playstation 3) and Super Monkey Ball 2 (Nintendo Wii). Then, each participant performed an augmentation mammoplasty procedure on a Mammoplasty Part-task Trainer, which allows the simulation of the essential steps of the procedure. Results: The average age of participants was 25.4 years. Correlation studies showed significant association between Perplexus Epic, Star Wars Racer, Super Monkey Ball scores and the modified OSATS score with rs = 0.8491 (p < 0.001), rs = −0.6941 (p = 0.005), and rs = 0.7309 (p < 0.003), but not with the Mikado score rs = −0.0255 (p = 0.9). Linear regressions were strongest for Perplexus Epic and Super Monkey Ball scores with coefficients of determination of 0.59 and 0.55, respectively. A combined score (Perplexus/Super-Monkey-Ball) was computed and showed a significant correlation with the modified OSATS score having an rs = 0.8107 (p < 0.001) and R2 = 0.75, respectively. Conclusions: This study identified a combination of skill games that correlated to better performance of novices on a surgical simulator. With refinement, such tools could serve to help screen plastic surgery applicants and identify those with higher surgical performance predictors. © 2018 Association of Program Directors in Surgery","Medical Knowledge; plastic surgery; Practice-Based Learning and Improvement; residents selection; simulation; skill-games; surgical skills; video games","Adult; Clinical Competence; Female; Forecasting; Humans; Internship and Residency; Male; Mammaplasty; Simulation Training; Surgery, Plastic; Video Games; adult; Article; breast augmentation; breast reconstruction; correlation coefficient; correlational study; human; learning curve; linear regression analysis; medical student; Perplexus Epic score; plastic surgery; prediction; priority journal; residency education; resident; scoring system; simulation; skill; Super Monkey Ball score; surgical training; video game; clinical competence; education; female; forecasting; male; medical education; plastic surgery; procedures; simulation training","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85045127044"

It also assessed the difference between those who played and those who watched the game. Participants of the study were male, high school, EFL students (N = 136, age 12–18) randomly assigned to two treatments: Players, who were exposed to the vocabulary through playing a digital video game and Watchers, who watched two classmates play the same game. After the treatment (one session a week for five weeks), an e-learning enjoyment scale and a vocabulary posttest were administered. In addition, researcher field notes were written down. Data analysis involved t tests, ANOVAs, and a standard multiple regression. The results indicated that e-learning enjoyment significantly predicted the variance in game-enhanced vocabulary learning. There was no significant difference between Players and Watchers. It is concluded that digital video games help language learners keep up through the sustained, long-term process of language learning by making it enjoyable. Also, the findings help identify better suited commercial video games for educational purposes and design more useful educational video games. © Centre for Language Studies National University of Singapore.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85041723869"

Active video games, active gaming, interactive games, movement-controlled video games, exertion games, and exergaming are terms used to define the kinds of video games in which the exertion interface enables a new experience. Exergames have added a component of physical activity to the otherwise motionless video game environment and have the potential to contribute to physical education classes by supplementing the current activity options and increasing student enjoyment. The use of exergames in schools has already shown positive results in the past through their potential to fight obesity. As for the pedagogical aspects of exergames, they have attracted educators’ attention due to the large number of games and activities that can be incorporated into the curriculum. In this way, the school must consider the development of a new physical education curriculum in which the key to promoting healthy physical activity in children and youth is enjoyment, using video games as a tool. In this context, the aim is to conduct a brief review of the use of exergames in physical education curriculum, exploring school curriculum, digital culture, and motivation and enjoyment for the learning processes in the video game environment. © 2018 De Gruyter Open Ltd.All right reserved.","Active gaming; Curriculum; Exergaming; Experience","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85057030986"

Although literature suggests that differences of parenting styles between immigrant and native-born American parents will influence children's learning, classroom teaching, and policy making, little is known about whether there is any difference in parental involvement in the video game process and parental perceptions of integrating video games into the regular classroom. In this aspect, an online survey was conducted. Consistent with our hypotheses, although the sampled native parents were more likely to hold an overall negative attitude toward violence in games, they were less worried about the integration of video games in the classroom than immigrant parents were. Results also suggested that the sampled immigrant parents were less involved in the game playing process than their counterpart native-born parents were. Additional correlation analyses revealed that if parents held more negative attitudes toward social effects brought on by the violence in video games, they would most likely use stricter mediation techniques toward their children's video game playing. On the other hand, the more negative the attitude was, the more involved parents were in their children's gameplay. Implications, limitations and future research opportunities were discussed. © Authors.","Cultural diversity; Parental attitude; Technology integration; Video game violence","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85040076133"

Mainstreaming these children is generally viewed as positive primarily because of the social factors associated with attending mainstream schools for children with SEN. Despite this commonly held view, there is increasing evidence to show that children with SEN have difficulties participating in mainstream environments. Using data from the Growing Up in Ireland study of 8,578 nine year olds, this paper examines whether peer relations differ among typically developing students and students with different types of SEN. We focus on the quantity and quality of peer relations using data on the child’s number of friends and, using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, the quality of relations with their peers. These measures are examined by controlling for a range of individual, home and school-level factors simultaneously in a regression model. Our findings show that, all else being equal, students with SEN, particularly those with emotional and behavioural difficulties (EBD), are more likely to have fewer friends and experience negative peer relationships compared to their peers without any additional needs. Based on these findings, we argue that specific interventions may be needed to promote positive peer experiences for children with SEN in mainstream education. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","inclusion; mainstream education; peer relations; Special educational needs","Article; behavior; child; comparative study; emotion; female; friend; home; human; Irish (citizen); learning; male; peer group; primary school; priority journal; school; self concept; special education; speech; sport; strengths and difficulties questionnaire; student; teaching; video game","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85019647673"

One aspect of parent-child play that is gaining interest is a form of physical play, ‘rough-and-tumble play’ (RTP), or roughhousing. RTP is most often played by fathers and has been shown to have positive benefits for children. However, little is known about parents’ perceptions of this type of play, although beliefs and values about learning through play shape parents’ interactions with their children. In this study, we investigated parents’ beliefs and knowledge about father–child RTP. A qualitative design was used to create a conceptual description of parents’ views, and 52 (31% male) Australian parents participated in semi-structured interviews supported by a video stimulus of father–child RTP. Three conceptual themes characterized parents’ perspectives on RTP: Strength Challenge describes the physicality and inter-personal challenge of the game; Dynamic Bonding describes how parents view RTP as fostering close father-child relationships, confidence and a playful state of mind; the final theme, Context and Caveats, integrates the contended and contingent aspects of RTP perceived to influence the short and long-term effects of this play. The study provides insight into how parents perceive the broad function of parent-child RTP and fathers’ role within this play. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Father-child play; Fathers; Parents’ beliefs; Rough-and-tumble play","Australian; child; father; female; human; learning; male; perception; semi structured interview; stimulus; videorecording","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85039797142"

Video analysis is not a new performance-enhancing element in sports, but PU is innovative in how it facilitates reflective learning. Video analysis is executed in the PU platform by involving the players in the analysis process, in the sense that they are encouraged to tag game actions in video-documented soccer matches. Following this, players can get virtual feedback from their coach. Findings show that PU can improve youth soccer players’ reflection skills through consistent video analyses and tagging; coaches are important as role models and providers of feedback; and that the use of the platform primarily stimulated deliberate practice activities. PU can be seen as a source of inspiration for soccer players and clubs as to how analytical platforms can motivate and enhance reflective learning for better in-game performance.

This shows the potential of using both authoring tools to have students engage creatively with subject matter and as a focal point of collaborative learning activity.

Game-centred approaches, such as teaching games for understanding, have been used in accordance with this perspective. The process of transferring learning responsibility takes place when the learner is building his/her own knowledge. Purpose: the aim of this paper is to explore how progressively transferring responsibility for learning from the coach to the players occurs in an ecological learning environment. We address it describing the joint activity organisation and its dynamic evolution for a coaching sequence of rugby through the analysis of interaction between the players and the coach. Participants and setting: Ten novice rugby players (aged 17–19) and a coach-researcher participated in this study. The study was conducted over a 6-week period with a total of 11 sessions, each of 90 minutes. Research design: the research was designed as participant observation in a unique case study based on the observation of an ecological learning environment in a rugby club. Data collection: We video- and audio-recorded the sessions. Transcripts of sessions, including all verbal exchanges and descriptions of participants’ motor performance, are the main source of data. Data analysis: The unit of analysis is the segment of interactivity (SI). This is defined as the period of time within a session in which verbal exchanges and specific behaviours by participants are under the same instructional function. SIs are identified by analysis of interactivity that is generated during the learning process; they are not given in advance. In this study we analyse the evolution of the identified SIs during the 11-lesson unit in an interactivity map. The map depicts changes that occur during the learning process in relation to the transfer of learning responsibility from the coach to the players. Results: we have identified six SIs: SI Activity Organisation, SI Guided Practice, SI Autonomous Practice, SI Discussion, SI Recapitulation and SI Transition. There was an evolution of these SIs over the course of the unit showing transfer of learning control from coach to learner. This was evident by a decrease in SIs Activity Organisation in conjunction with an increase in SIs of Guided and Autonomous Practice. We also show that reflection time is firstly organised around specific SI Discussion, but progressively transferred to reflection during the guided practice, mainly about tactical aspects. Conclusions: In consonance with other research conducted in naturalistic physical education and sports contexts, we observe that the learning transfer process occurs but is neither linear nor progressive. We obtained specific evidences of this process, although we find abrupt changes in the shape of breakdowns and disruptions that make this process partially unpredictable. The consistent situations of discussion and reflection that appear in the SIs Discussion, Recapitulation and Guided Practice seem to play an important role that facilitates game understanding of learners. We consider the analysis of real teaching and learning settings to be of paramount importance to understand the educational influence that emerges in the knowledge construction in sports pedagogy. © 2017 Association for Physical Education.","game-centred approach; interactivity; rugby union; scaffolding; Social constructivism","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85021846892"

This requires professional development that embeds educators in the social practice of games while they learn how to play and implement them in classroom practice. This article describes the design considerations around the ongoing TESOL Electronic Village Online (EVO) Minecraft Massively Open Online Course (MOOC) that mimics the social practices around video games by reimagining professional development as a participatory culture. This participatory-culture approach anchors participants’ learning of the video game Minecraft in a multiyear community of educators who share ideas, post videos, blog, and play Minecraft together.

We report the design of a media-based mentoring system to support middle school students in engaging in argumentation in the context of a game-infused science curriculum. Our design emphasizes learners apprenticing with college student mentors around the socio-scientific inquiry of a designed video game. We report the results of a mixed-methods study examining the use of this media-based mentoring system with students ages 11 through 14. We observed that the discourse of groups of students that engaged with the game-infused science curriculum while interacting with college student mentors via a social media platform demonstrated statistically significant higher ratings of cognitive, epistemic, and social aspects of argumentation than groups of students that engaged with the social media platform and game-infused science curriculum without mentors. We further explored the differences between the Discourses of the mentored and non-mentored groups. This analysis showed that students in the mentored groups were invited, guided, and socialized into roles of greater agency than students in the non-mentored groups. This increased agency might explain why mentored groups demonstrated higher levels of scientific argumentation than non-mentored groups. Based on our analyses, we argue that media-based mentoring may be designed around a video game to support middle school students in engaging in argumentation from evidence. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Argumentation; Digital learning environments; Discourse analysis; Mentoring; Socio-scientific inquiry; Video games","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85034598472"

This objective is achieved by designing and developing an Android-based app, known as 3R Interactive Games (3R-IG). 3R-IG consists an opening video which describes information related to the Earth. Several loading screens are created which contain 3R information and mini games to raise players’ awareness while waiting for the games to load. A recycle calculator is embedded in the app to enable players to compute their 3R effort achievements. 3R-IG provides two dimensions of interactive games directed at beginner and advance players. The aim is to educate users and influence their attitude to execute the practice of 3R. An experimental analysis was carried out to a total of 30 undergraduate students from Multimedia University, Malacca Campus, Malaysia.

As a result, game characteristics have been applied to education and training, where they are known as serious games. There is an increase in the volume of literature on serious games in healthcare education; however, evidence on their impact is still ambiguous. Aims: The aims of this study were (i) to identify high-quality evidence (systematic reviews or meta-analyses) regarding impacts of serious games on healthcare education; and (ii) to explore evidence regarding impacts of serious games in dental education. Methods: A rapid review of the literature was undertaken to synthesise available evidence and examine serious games in healthcare education (Stage 1) and dental education (Stage 2). Results: Nine systematic reviews were included in Stage 1, four of which were of high, three of moderate and two of low quality. For Stage 2, two randomised control trials with moderate quality were included. The findings demonstrated that serious games are potentially effective learning tools in terms of knowledge and skills improvement, although outcomes of serious games over traditional learning approaches were not consistent. In addition, serious games appeared to be more engaging and satisfying for students, which could be considered as the most important positive impact. Conclusion: Serious games provide an option for healthcare and dental education but remain underutilised and researched. At best, they offer a similar experience to other methods in relation to educational outcome; however, they can provide a supplementary strategy to engage students and improve learner satisfaction. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

However, the concept of remix is common across this wide range of media, and offers practitioners ‘endless hybridizations in language, genre, content, technique and the like’ (Knobel & Lankshear, 2008, p. 22). The conceptual commonality of remix indicates that the study conclusions will have useful implications across a range of media production disciplines. This study aims to consider new methods for testing creativity in media production learning activities and to provide better assessments for learning design. This study focused upon a learner cohort of music technology students that were undertaking a work-integrated learning programme with a record label. To make the students more work-ready and inspire greater creativity, they remixed tracks recorded by professional music artists as part of a unit assessment. Subsequent self-report surveys (N = 29) found that the process of creating a ‘remix’ enhanced their creativity and provided suggested improvements to the design of the learning experience. Importantly, we found no relationship between the survey responses and objective assessments, indicating that the self-reported improvements in creativity were not simply a measure of how well the students performed the formally assessed tasks. Although more research is needed to establish effective measures of creativity, these findings demonstrate that self-report survey tools can be a powerful tool for measuring creativity and supporting improved iterative learning design. © 2017, © 2017 University of Wollongong.","Creativity; learning design; music technology; produsage; remix","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85034997842"

We argue that simulations can be usefully employed at the early transition from “novice” to “advanced beginner” in a learning process, where the student begins to leave behind rational rules in favor of an own situational experience. However, currently available IR simulations for teaching purposes are often high-cost/high-tech and especially time-intensive: if they do not require custom-made software packages with difficult interfaces and expensive licensing fees, they are often targeted at course-long or at least day-long activities that demand extensive preparation of both teachers and students, with book-length manuals, intricate rules, integrated assessment tools, and specific secondary literature, and conventionally target more experienced students. This article explains how teachers can create an easily accessible and class-long (50 minutes) interactive experience for undergraduate IR students to encourage theoretical linkage with own in-class experience at a very low cost. We do this by employing PowerPoint, specifically in-built features such as hyperlinks, interactive pathways, or audio or video integration that can be used interactively rather than passively (as in a standard presentation). © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Active learning; decision making; games; PowerPoint; practical learning; simulations; teaching","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85035809648"

We investigated whether Quandary, a video game designed to promote ethical thinking and moral considerations for decision-making, would help promote positive skills such as perspective taking and empathy in adolescents. We examined the effect of playing Quandary on 131 middle school students on self-reported measures of moral thinking via mixed-method randomized control trials. In addition, we conducted qualitative analyses of one-on-one participant interviews and short-answer responses to capture experiences and reflections from playing Quandary, as well as the depth in which students across conditions responded to the interview questions. We found that short-term quantitative indicators did not show change across conditions; however, qualitative analyses revealed thematic responses that are consistent with the core components of the Quandary game, and that students in the Quandary condition showed a greater depth of response to interview questions.

The purpose of this study was to provide an initial evaluation of the efficacy of the FFW intervention to increase well-being actions. Materials and Methods: The study design was a secondary data analysis of a large-scale prospective, double-blind, parallel-group randomized controlled trial. Data were collected at baseline and 30 and 60 days postbaseline. A total of 479 adult employees at a major university in the southeast of the United States of America were enrolled. Participants who were randomly assigned to the FFW group were provided with 30 days of 24-hour access to the intervention. A two-class linear regression model with complier average causal effect estimation was fitted to well-being actions scores at 30 and 60 days. Results: Intent-to-treat analysis provided evidence that the effect of being assigned to the FFW intervention, without considering actual participation in the FFW intervention, had a null effect on each dimension of well-being actions at 30 and 60 days. Participants who complied with the FFW intervention, however, had significantly higher well-being actions scores, compared to potential compliers in the Usual Care group, in the interpersonal dimension at 60 days, and the physical dimension at 30 days. Conclusions: Results from this secondary data analysis provide some supportive evidence for both the efficacy of and possible revisions to the FFW intervention in regard to promoting well-being actions. © 2018 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.","Complier average causal effect modeling; I COPPE actions scale; Intent to treat","Adult; Double-Blind Method; Female; Health Behavior; Health Promotion; Humans; Internet; Learning; Male; Middle Aged; Pleasure; Prospective Studies; Video Games; adult; controlled study; double blind procedure; female; health behavior; health promotion; human; Internet; learning; male; middle aged; pleasure; procedures; prospective study; randomized controlled trial; video game","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85051475821"

The 3- dimensional spaces used in the games, which have been modelled with great success, have recently been associated with real-world examples by directly copying the original spaces. While the player's perception of the environment and space during the game are both auditory and knowledge, which is a result of hand and eye coordination and this acquisition process is also facilitated with the guidance, instructions and directions provided by the game. The story, architectural and graphic elements used in the game made extremely important contributions to the success of the game.

The intervention combined the use of the co-op action role-playing game Torchlight II and analogue gamification aimed at including 32 students challenged by social difficulties and lack of motivation. The video game was used to create more inclusive classrooms by increasing students’ opportunities for participation through collaboration in teams. The students also participated in game-related Danish (L1) and Mathematics activities. Effects on social well-being, learning and motivational patterns were measured through teacher assessment combined with the Children's Perceived Locus of Causality-scales. The results show multidimensional effects including positive impact on at-risk students’ well-being and reduced experiences of external regulation to participate in Mathematics and Danish. The qualitative analysis not only confirms the positive findings, but also shows how the intervention created ambiguities surrounding the relationship between game activities and curriculum-related assignments. The findings indicate that the impact of game-based classrooms is not due to their fun element, but rather how they enable reframing of social participation and students’ engagement with the curriculum. © 2018 British Educational Research Association.","","Curricula; Human computer interaction; Interactive computer graphics; Teaching; External regulations; Game-based Learning; Locus of causality; Multidimensional effects; Qualitative analysis; Social participation; Social well-being; Teacher assessments; Students","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85050809432"

Past research demonstrates that serious games are prime candidates to utilise these principles, however the potential benefits of this approach for delivering drug education are yet to be examined in Australia, a country where drug education in schools is mandatory. Design and Methods: The serious game ‘Pure Rush’ was developed across three stages. First, formative consultation was conducted with 115 students (67% male, aged 15–17 years), followed by feasibility and acceptability testing of a prototype of the game (n = 25, 68% male). In the final stage, 281 students (62% female, aged 13–16 years) were randomly allocated to receive a lesson involving Pure Rush or an active control lesson. The lessons were compared in terms of learning outcomes, lesson engagement and future intentions to use illicit drugs. Results: Students enjoyed playing Pure Rush, found the game age-appropriate and the information useful to them. Both the Pure Rush and the active control were associated with significant knowledge increase from pre to post-test. Among females, multi-level mixed-effects regression showed knowledge gain was greater in the Pure Rush condition compared to control (β = 2.36, 95% confidence interval 0.36–4.38). There was no evidence of between condition differences in lesson engagement or future intentions to use illicit drugs. Discussion and Conclusions: Pure Rush is an innovative online drug education game that is well received by students and feasible to implement in schools.

Methods: This pilot study was conducted at an academic teaching hospital and included 24 undergraduate medical students who were novices in ORL-HNS. The cognitive style was determined using the Group Embedded Figures Test. The participants were randomly allocated (1:1) to one of the two groups matched by age, sex, and cognitive style: the IM group and the PPS group. During the 100-min learning period, the participants were unblinded to use the IM or PPS courseware on a 7-inch tablet. Pretests and posttests using multiple-choice questions to evaluate knowledge and multimedia situational tests to evaluate competence were administered. Participants evaluated their satisfaction and learning experience by the AttrakDiff2 questionnaire, and provided feedback about the modules. Results: Overall, the participants had significant gains in knowledge (median of percentage change 71, 95% CI 1-100, P<.001) and competence (median of percentage change 25, 95% CI 0-33, P=.007) after 100 min of learning. Although there was no significant difference in knowledge gain between the two groups (median of difference of percentage change 24, 95% CI −75 to 36; P=.55), competence gain was significantly lower in the IM group compared with the PPS group (median of difference of percentage change −41, 95% CI −67 to −20; P=.008). However, the IM group had significantly higher scores of satisfaction (difference 2, 95% CI 2-4; P=.01), pragmatic quality (difference 1.7, 95% CI 0.1-2.7; P=.03), and hedonic stimulation (difference 1.9, 95% CI 0.3-3.1; P=.01) compared with the PPS group. Qualitative feedback indicated that the various games in the IM module attracted the participants’ attention but that the nonlinearly arranged materials affected their learning. Conclusions: Using M-TEL for undergraduate medical education on emergent ORL-HNS disorders, an IM module seems to be useful for gaining knowledge, but competency may need to occur elsewhere. While the small sample size reduces the statistical power of our results, its design seems to be appropriate to determine the effects of M-TEL using a larger group.

Procedural generation of user-tailored content increases the self-motivation of players as they immerse themselves in the virtual world. An adaptive user model is needed to capture the skills of the player and enable automatic game content altering algorithms to fit the individual user. We propose an adaptive user modelling approach using a combination of unobtrusive physiological data to identify strengths and weaknesses in user performance in car racing games. Our system creates user-tailored tracks to improve driving habits and user experience, and to keep engagement at high levels. The user modelling approach adopts concepts from the Trace Theory framework; it uses machine learning to extract features from the user’s physiological data and game-related actions, and cluster them into low level primitives. These primitives are transformed and evaluated into higher level abstractions such as experience, exploration and attention. These abstractions are subsequently used to provide track alteration decisions for the player. Collection of data and feedback from 52 users allowed us to associate key model variables and outcomes to user responses, and to verify that the model provides statistically significant decisions personalised to the individual player. Tailored game content variations between users in our experiments, as well as the correlations with user satisfaction demonstrate that our algorithm is able to automatically incorporate user feedback in subsequent procedural content generation. © 2017, The Author(s).","Adaptive modelling; Car racing game; Machine learning; Personalised gaming; Physiological models; Theory of flow; User modelling; User study","Abstracting; Artificial intelligence; Game theory; Human computer interaction; Interactive computer graphics; Learning systems; Physiology; Racing automobiles; Virtual reality; Adaptive modelling; Personalised gaming; Theory of flow; User Modelling; User study; Physiological models","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85018440507"

Method: Nine patients diagnosed with PD, hypokinetic dysarthria, and impaired speech intelligibility participated in a training program aimed at increasing the size of their articulatory (tongue) movements during sentences. Two sessions were conducted: a baseline and training session, followed by a retention session 48 hr later. At baseline, sentences were produced at normal, loud, and clear speaking conditions. Game-based visual feedback regarding the size of the articulatory working space (AWS) was presented during training. Results: Eight of nine participants benefited from training, increasing their sentence AWS to a greater degree following feedback as compared with the baseline loud and clear conditions.

However, our understanding of the development of skill and the cognitive representations that support skilled performance can be limited by a focus on game scores. We present an alternative approach to the study of skill acquisition in video games based on the tools of the Expert Performance Approach. Our investigation was motivated by a detailed analysis of the behaviors responsible for the superior performance of one of the highest scoring players of the video game Space Fortress (Towne, Boot, & Ericsson,). This analysis revealed how certain behaviors contributed to his exceptional performance. In this study, we recruited a participant for a similar training regimen, but we collected concurrent and retrospective verbal protocol data throughout training. Protocol analysis revealed insights into strategies, errors, mental representations, and shifting game priorities. We argue that these insights into the developing representations that guided skilled performance could only easily have been derived from the tools of the Expert Performance Approach. We propose that the described approach could be applied to understand performance and skill acquisition in many different video games (and other short- to medium-term skill acquisition paradigms) and help reveal mechanisms of transfer from gameplay to other measures of laboratory and real-world performance.

Individuals were trained on six combat vehicles in a simulation, presented through either a stereoscopic or non-stereoscopic display. Participants then reported flow state, VGE and were tested on their ability to discriminate friend vs. foe and identify both pictures and videos of the trained vehicles. The effect of stereoscopy was not significant. There was an effect of gender across three dependent measures. For the two picture-based measures, the effect of gender was mediated by VGE. Additionally, the effect of gender was moderated by flow state on the identification measures. Overall, the study suggests that gender differences may be overcome by VGE and by achieving flow state. Selection based on these individual differences may be useful for future military simulation. Practitioner Summary: This work investigates the effect of gender, VGE and flow state on CID performance.

Nevertheless, despite an increasing academic interest in EVGs little research has been devoted to delve into teacher's beliefs affecting their attitude towards EVGs and how these beliefs also affect their intention to use EVGs in their courses. Using Keller's ARCS model as a theoretical framework, the role of perceived relevance and attention in teachers' attitude and intention to use EVGs is analyzed. To do so a research model is tested using a sample of 312 Higher Education teachers via structural equation modeling to predict teachers' attitude and behavioral intention to use EVGs in their courses. Results suggest that perceived attention drawn by EVGs is a factor affecting teachers' intentions to use EVGs in their courses. Perceived relevance was not found to affect directly neither attitude nor intention to use while teachers' perceived attention was found to affect teachers' perceived relevance of EVGs.

Our study explored the potential of gamified on-line undergraduate physics content as a mechanism to enhance student learning and motivation. Specifically, the main objective of this work was to determine whether extrinsic motivation indicators commonly used in video games could increase student engagement with course content outside of the classroom. Life Science students taking an introductory physics course were provided access to gamified multiple choice quizzes as part of their course assessment. The quizzes incorporated common gaming elements such as points, streaks, leaderboards and achievements, as well as some gamified graphical enhancements and feedback. Student attitudes and performance among those using the gamified quizzes were examined and compared to non-gamified control groups within the same course. Student engagement was quantified through examining student participation above and beyond the minimum course requirements. The results showed that gaming techniques are significantly correlated with increased engagement with course material outside of the classroom. These results may assist instructors in engaging and motivating students outside the classroom through carefully designed online and distance-delivered undergraduate physics content. Furthermore, the gaming elements incorporated in this study were not specifically tied to the physics content and can be easily translated to any educational setting. © 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84984707514"

College students played a custom video game, Alien Game, which required the executive function skill of shifting between competing tasks. When students played for 2 h over 4 sessions they developed significantly better performance on cognitive shifting tests compared to a control group that played a different game (d = 0.62), but not when they played for 1 h over 2 sessions. Students who played Alien Game at a high level of challenge (i.e., reaching a high level in the game) developed significantly better performance on cognitive shifting tests compared to controls when they played for 2 h (Experiment 1, d = 1.44), but not when they played for 1 h (Experiment 2). Experiment 3 replicated the results of Experiment 1 using an inactive control group, showing that playing Alien Game for 2 h resulted in significant improvements in shifting skills (d = 0.78). Results show the effectiveness of playing a custom-made game that focuses on a specific executive function skill for sufficient time at an appropriate level of challenge. Results support the specific transfer of general skills theory, in which practice of a cognitive skill in a game context transferred to performance on the same skill in a non-game context. © 2017","Cognitive training; Computer games; Executive function; Serious games; Video games","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85027878015"

Objective To address that clinical gap, our team developed a virtual game-based simulation to help nursing students develop their pediatric nursing skills. Design A usability study was conducted using the Technology Acceptance Model as a research framework. Setting and Participants The study was conducted at a community college and included nursing students, nursing faculty/clinicians and two gaming experts. Methods The two experts evaluated the game using a heuristic checklist after playing the game. Participants engaged in a think-aloud activity while playing the game and completed a survey and interview based on the Technology Acceptance Model to explore ease of use and utility of the game. Results We found a high degree of user satisfaction with the game. Students reported that they had learned about pediatric care, they had become immersed in the game and they were keen to keep playing. Several design changes were recommended. Conclusion Usability testing is critical in the early stages of simulation development and the study provided useful direction for the development team in the next stage of game development. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","E-simulation; Nursing education; Online; Pediatrics; Usability test","Adult; Clinical Competence; Computer Simulation; Education, Nursing; Female; Humans; Learning; Middle Aged; Pediatric Nursing; Students, Nursing; User-Computer Interface; Video Games; checklist; child; community college; human; human experiment; interview; model; nursing education; nursing student; pediatric nursing; pediatrics; satisfaction; skill; adult; clinical competence; computer interface; computer simulation; education; female; learning; middle aged; nursing education; nursing student; pediatric nursing; procedures; psychology; video game","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84985991237"

Following in this tradition, we produced a series of video games called Bacon Brains. However, unlike many other programs, ours focused on the “Science of Addiction,” providing lessons on how alcohol and other drugs affect the brain. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of our games in teaching students our science-based curriculum. We enrolled more than 200 students and randomly assigned them to play our games or a different series of National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)-produced games. Of the students in the Bacon Brains conditions, half were instructed to play collaboratively and the other half was told to play competitively. Results indicate significantly greater knowledge gains among students in Bacon Brains compared to the existing games (5.01 mean knowledge score difference; [F(1,242) = 9.588, p =.002]). Girls demonstrated knowledge gains in both collaborative and competitive conditions, but boys demonstrated similar gains only in the competitive condition. Based on our outcomes, we conclude that video games can serve as an effective method of science instruction.

A model for Thinking for Learning, “think-to-learn-to-think,” is discussed and children's activities are used to define the stages of this cycle. The study of children's pre–during–after project “Thinking Maps” and explanations during group discussions suggests that their thinking sequences were altered during and after their game design activities.

Theory suggests that biases can be overcome by training in critical reflective thinking. In addition, applied research studies have suggested that game-based training is more effective at reducing bias than conventional forms of training, for example due to the interactive and dynamic nature of video-games. However, earlier studies have not always controlled systematically for the nature of the learning environment between conditions (e.g., providing different content and bias examples for instruction and training). We manipulated in a between-subjects study whether participants received critical-reflective thinking training (yes/no) and in what context they experienced this training (an interactive detective game, or a text-script of the game). Positive effects of training were found. However, the mitigating effects on bias depended upon the type of bias and when the effects were measured (near or far transfer). Surprisingly, the game group performed similar to the text-script group. This suggests that an interactive and dynamic training context (e.g., a game) is not necessarily more effective than non-dynamic contexts (e.g., a text) for bias-mitigation training. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Bias mitigation; Cognitive bias; Computer games; Critical thinking; Training","Computer aided instruction; Decision making; Human computer interaction; Interactive computer graphics; Personnel training; Bias mitigation; Cognitive bias; Critical thinking; Game-based trainings; Judgment and decision makings; Learning environments; Mitigating effects; Reflective thinking; Computer games","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85018515285"

The effectiveness of traditional lecture-based classrooms has been questioned by educators, parents, industry, and government. In the field of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, the importance of hands-on learning and traditional classroom teaching underscores the need for curriculum reform. This paper presents a methodology to improve graduates' knowledge and skills in the area of fluid mechanics in an ongoing curriculum reform process. The course syllabus is reformed to support a multi-modal student learning process. Beyond current lecture-based classroom teaching, tools are developed to foster flexible, inductive learning through hands-on applications, and online learning tools. A multipurpose laboratory equipped with fluid power processes, sensors, data acquisition systems, and application programs has been established and it is being developed every semester. The laboratory experiments utilize fluid mechanics principles in industrial applications to provide students a robust understanding of the subject. Because of the practice of industrial processes, use of sensors, data acquisition hardware, and application programs in the laboratory, the technical skills of program graduates improve significantly. Finally, the project evaluation, assessment, and dissemination process for monitoring and evaluating project activities, outcomes assessment of student learning, and feedback for continuous curriculum improvement are presented. © 2013 IEEE.","adaptive learning; fluid mechanics and fluid power; Hands-on practice; inductive learning","Application programs; Computer software; Curricula; Data acquisition; Education; Fluid mechanics; Learning systems; Mechanics; Mobile phones; Project management; Students; Teaching; Adaptive learning; Data acquisition hardware; Data acquisition system; Fluid power; Hands-on practice; Inductive learning; Science , technology , engineering , and mathematics; Student learning process; Engineering education","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85016288041"

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine longitudinally the links between subtypes of social withdrawal, connective media (e.g., e-mail, social networking) and problematic (forms of media such as violent video games that, when used in high amounts, have been found to be linked to indices of maladjustment) media use, and internalizing and externalizing behaviors.

Results revealed that avoidant individuals use problematic forms of media more than average, unsociable, and shy individuals. Furthermore, problematic media use predicted more withdrawn behavior at Time 2 and mediated the relation between avoidance and externalizing behaviors over time. Few problems were found for unsociable behavior. The need to differentiate between multiple forms of withdrawal in emerging adulthood and their links with problematic forms of media and subsequent risk factors is discussed. © 2016 American Psychological Association.","Avoidant; Media; Shyness; Social withdrawal; Unsocial","Adolescent; Adult; Avoidance Learning; Depression; Electronic Mail; Female; Humans; Male; Models, Psychological; Models, Statistical; Personality; Pyrroles; Social Isolation; Social Media; Students; Surveys and Questionnaires; United States; Universities; Video Games; Young Adult; longmide B; pyrrole derivative; adolescent; adult; avoidance behavior; depression; e-mail; female; human; male; personality; psychological model; psychology; questionnaire; social isolation; social media; statistical model; student; United States; university; video game; young adult","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84970024472"

However, it is not clear how such changes might influence the way we overtly select information from our visual world (i.e. eye movements). We examined whether action-video-game training changed eye movement behaviour in a series of visual search tasks including conjunctive search (relatively abstracted from natural behaviour), game-related search, and more naturalistic scene search. Forty nongamers were trained in either an action first-person shooter game or a card game (control) for 10 hours. As a further control, we recorded eye movements of 20 experienced action gamers on the same tasks. The results did not show any change in duration of fixations or saccade amplitude either from before to after the training or between all nongamers (pretraining) and experienced action gamers. However, we observed a change in search strategy, reflected by a reduction in the vertical distribution of fixations for the game-related search task in the action-game-trained group. This might suggest learning the likely distribution of targets. In other words, game training only skilled participants to search game images for targets important to the game, with no indication of transfer to the more natural scene search. Taken together, these results suggest no modification in overt allocation of attention. Either the skills that can be trained with action gaming are not powerful enough to influence information selection through eye movements, or action-game-learned skills are not used when deciding where to move the eyes. © 2016, The Psychonomic Society, Inc.","Eye guidance; Eye movements; Game training; Learning; Visual search","Adolescent; Adult; Attention; Eye Movements; Female; Humans; Learning; Male; Photic Stimulation; Psychomotor Performance; Saccades; Video Games; Young Adult; adolescent; adult; attention; eye movement; female; human; learning; male; photostimulation; physiology; procedures; psychology; psychomotor performance; saccadic eye movement; video game; young adult","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85006096626"

However, gaming experts' available working memory did not predict better comprehension. Instead, non-experts' available working memory predicted better comprehension. Study 2 further examined whether these results were caused by insufficient working memory allocation or different attention focus between gaming experts and non-experts.

This article presents the Gamer Response and Decision Framework as a tool for understanding how people interpret, make decisions, and learn during their video gaming experiences. Background. The Gamer Response and Decision Framework combines Rosenblatt’s Reader Response Theory with a variety of other concepts and frameworks related to new literacies, multimodality, learning theory, psychology, and video gaming. This Framework illustrates that every individual has unique experiences, knowledge, skills, agency, self-efficacy, and goals, and these components influence how people interpret and make decisions during video gameplay, which affects how the game unfolds as a unique experience for each gamer. Together these ideas illustrate that no two gamers have the same experience when playing a video game. Understanding video gameplay experiences is important as it represents a dynamic process in which gamers interpret a wide variety of multimodal symbols, experiment and learn in these digital environments, and solve complex problems in order to progress in the game. Conclusion. The Gamer Response and Decision Framework can be used to understand, investigate, and analyze video gameplay experiences and has significant implications for our understanding the thought, decision-making, and learning processes that gamers experience. In the future, researchers in a variety of fields including education, game studies, and game design can use this framework to analyze how people interact with video games. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","engagement and learning; game analysis; gamer response and decision framework; Gibson’s Theory of Affordances; learning; literacy practice; multimodality; new literacies; video games","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84987817837"

Recent technological innovations, including the rapid adoption of smartphones by society, have facilitated the access to virtual reality and augmented reality of anyone. In addition, several large companies like Apple, Facebook, Samsung, and Magic Leap, among others, have increased their investment to make these technologies to improve their accessibility within the next few years. Educational institutions will benefit from better accessibility to virtual technologies; this will make it possible to teach in virtual environments that are impossible to visualize in physical classrooms, like accessing into virtual laboratories, visualizing machines, industrial plants, or even medical scenarios.

Their flexibility in use and scalability makes them an attractive learning tool, but more research is needed on the effectiveness of serious games compared to more traditional formats such e-modules. We investigated whether undergraduate medical students developed better knowledge and awareness and were more motivated after learning about patient-safety through a serious game than peers who studied the same topics using an e-module. Methods: Fourth-year medical students were randomly assigned to either a serious game that included video-lectures, biofeedback exercises and patient missions (n = 32) or an e-module, that included text-based lectures on the same topics (n = 34). A third group acted as a historical control-group without extra education (n = 37). After the intervention, which took place during the clinical introduction course, before the start of the first rotation, all students completed a knowledge test, a self-efficacy test and a motivation questionnaire. During the following 10-week clinical rotation they filled out weekly questionnaires on patient-safety awareness and stress. Results: The results showed patient safety knowledge had equally improved in the game group and e-module group compared to controls, who received no extra education. Average learning-time was 3 h for the game and 1 h for the e-module-group. The serious game was evaluated as more engaging; the e-module as more easy to use. During rotations, students in the three groups reported low and similar levels of patient-safety awareness and stress. Students who had treated patients successfully during game missions experienced higher self-efficacy and less stress during their rotation than students who treated patients unsuccessfully. Conclusions: Video-lectures (in a game) and text-based lectures (in an e-module) can be equally effective in developing knowledge on specific topics. Although serious games are strongly engaging for students and stimulate them to study longer, they do not necessarily result in better performance in patient safety issues. © 2016 The Author(s).","Design-based research; Knowledge; Motivation; Patient Safety; Performance; Self-efficacy; Serious games","Analysis of Variance; Awareness; Chi-Square Distribution; Clinical Clerkship; Computer-Assisted Instruction; Education, Medical, Undergraduate; Female; Humans; Male; Patient Safety; Program Evaluation; Self Efficacy; Stress, Psychological; Students, Medical; Surveys and Questionnaires; Video Games; Young Adult; clinical article; comparative effectiveness; control group; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; education; exercise; feedback system; human; learning; medical student; motivation; patient safety; questionnaire; randomized controlled trial; rotation; self concept; stress; videorecording; analysis of variance; awareness; chi square distribution; clinical education; etiology; female; male; medical education; mental stress; prevention and control; procedures; program evaluation; psychology; self concept; standards; statistics and numerical data; teaching; video game; young adult","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85011321689"

This study focuses on an eight-week long MMOG gaming project, in which two groups of participants played WoW with a native German speaker in order to investigate the effects inter-group dynamics have on a participant’s real-time target language production and willingness to communicate. Participants reported during interviews and written journal entries that a lack of shared interests and motivation (learning and gaming) negatively affected the groups’ target language participation. The findings additionally suggest that a trained foreign language instructor paired with a motivated learner may result in increased participation; however, these increases may be temporary if a group’s relationship does not extend beyond the shared goal of foreign language improvement. © 2017, equinox publishing.","Community; Extramural; Gaming; MMOG; SLA","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85013428304"

Smartphones, tablets and laptops have equipped us with a plethora of applications that we can use creatively to communicate in ever more effective ways. We can now have a text-based conversation on our devices with photos, web links (possibly to audiovisual media) and even GPS locations. Videoconferencing platforms enable us to combine voice and text chat, share all kinds of files (documents, pictures, audio/ video recordings, whiteboards) and work on them collaboratively. The immersive platforms of virtual worlds integrate written and oral communication tools, which can be complemented with an array of bodily movements that avatars can reproduce in different scenarios while engaging in action. Additionally, in online games, and more specifically in Massively Multiplayer Online Games (MMOGs), gamers interact as avatars with other players in complex ways resorting to different communication modes to solve problems, complete quests, plan strategies and coordinate action to achieve the game goals. The widespread availability and sophistication of multimodal communication tools have captured the imagination of practitioners and scholars alike, who have identified interesting learning opportunities and fields of enquiry for language teaching.

A design-based research approach synthesizes staff interviews with student observations, interviews and artifacts to identify a set of generalizable best practices or design principles for empowering young people to move from being consumers of digital media to producers. These principles are illustrated with a case study of the 3D Animation and Gaming track from the second ITEST grant. Researchers argue for the importance of attending to the noncognitive elements of learning and illustrate ways in which instructors encouraged creative expression, personal agency, and collaboration through long-term projects. They also identify strategies for sustaining young people’s participation through the establishment of a supportive community environment. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Digital media production; Gaming; Science Technology Engineering Arts and Mathematics (STEAM); Twenty-first-century skills; Workforce development","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84978757604"

This paper outlines an experimental study that analyzes the effectiveness of flipped classroom design, and argues how the use of technological, educational resources such as videos of educators teaching, interactive materials, simulators, virtual labs and game-based learning have facilitated the use of class time for active learning and discussion. The study was conducted in several academic years with groups studying Fundamentals of Computer Technology, a core subject in the first year of the Computer Engineering and Information Systems degree courses. We analyzed data collected from online activities on a learning platform created from scratch, from classroom activities and from attitudinal and satisfaction surveys. We compared the evolution of outcomes between the 2009-2010 and 2015-2016 academic years. The methodology followed a quantitative design with control and experimental groups, and descriptive statistical techniques were used. The results obtained show that learning achievement and performance in terms of qualifications were higher in the experimental groups, where the flipped classroom approach using technological resources was adopted, than in the control groups, where the traditional lecture approach was used. A significant positive effect on participation, engagement and student satisfaction was also identified. © 2017 TEMPUS Publications.","Educational technology; Flipped classroom; Game-based learning; Mobile devices; Online learning environment; Videos; Virtual laboratories","Computer aided instruction; Curricula; Distance education; E-learning; Educational technology; Engineering education; Mobile devices; Online systems; Students; Teaching; Flipped classroom; Game-based Learning; Online learning environment; Videos; Virtual laboratories; Education","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85022075531"

The participants were 95 university students with no prior RPA or conventional aviation experience. Participants completed the EXPERT Intensive Skills Evaluation (EXPERTise) 2.0 web-delivered cue-based Situational Judgement Test (SJT) to ascertain their level of cue utilization and a series of spatial aptitude batteries. The participants then completed two 15 min simulated small VLOS rotary-wing RPA piloting tasks. A performance score, based on the proportion of successful trials, comprised the dependent variable for task one and a composite performance score, based on the proportion of successful trials, progression through the obstacle course, and time to complete a course, comprised the dependent variable for task two. The results indicated that, during the initial task, performance was explained by total video game experience and levels of spatial visualisation, while performance during the second task was explained by levels of cue utilization. This outcome suggests the involvement of different cognitive constructs at different stages in the initial and immediately subsequent stages of unstructured learning to operate a simulated VLOS rotary-wing RPA. The results suggest that the small VLOS remote pilot training industry might benefit from the development of cue-based training packages that assist trainees acquire interpret, integrate, calibrate and adapt the right sorts of cues that facilitate or accelerate the acquisition of competence and ultimately the progression to expertise. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Cue utilization; Remotely piloted aircraft; Skill acquisition; Spatial aptitude","Curricula; Fighter aircraft; Mergers and acquisitions; Personnel training; Remote control; Training aircraft; Dependent variables; Different stages; Remotely piloted aircraft; Skill acquisition; Spatial aptitude; Training packages; University students; Unstructured learning; adult; aircraft; airplane pilot; aptitude; Article; association; aviation; calibration; cognition; cross-sectional study; decision making; education program; expert system; female; human; human experiment; learning; male; mental test; normal human; personal experience; prediction; priority journal; professional competence; scoring system; simulation; Situational Judgement Test; skill; task performance; university student; video game; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85020037515"

The learning content is conveyed by activities of production and perception of prosodic phenomena, aimed at increasing their communicative competence. These activities are introduced within the narrative of a video game so that the players do not conceive the tool as a mere succession of learning activities, but so that they learn and improve their speech while playing.

These include: an internet cafe´, which allowed the players to be co-present; a personal laptop, which gave the player more control over how he played; and at home through game consoles using Xbox Live, which let the players communicate with one another through a headset. Using ethnographic research methods, I describe how their decisions about when, with whom and how they played were shaped by different sets of circumstances that were connected to real world issues and constraints. The ANT analysis focuses on three dimensions: network assemblage (what humans, technologies and routines need to be in place for them to play); translation (what holds their network together, and how these networks can be disrupted); and multiplicity (what other actor-networks exist that affect their play experience, in-game strategies and relationships). Finally, I conclude by reflecting on research on games and learning, and argue that it is important to avoid over-generalizing what makes up ‘‘games’’ and ‘‘players’’ because different players are part of different actor-networks, and that understanding these networks help us understand how games fit into the lives of those who play them. © The Author(s) 2017.","Actor-network theory; Adolescents; English language learners; Participatory cultures; Sociotechnical; Video games","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85018249046"

Participating youth from two research sites-an urban middle school and a suburban junior high school-wore FitBits that tracked their physical activity and then integrated their real-world energy into game-world resource boosts. This incorporation of daily life as a mechanic of the video game creates a tangible connection between players' physical and virtual experiences. To better understand that connection, this article presents survey, GIS, and mapping data to detail the two communities as multi-domain ecologies, and then presents interview and focus group data to illustrate the players' perceptions of the affordances and limitations of their physical environments. Ultimately, the authors argue that a multi-layered analysis of real world communities is essential for designing games for health and for effectively facilitating game-based learning within players' complex ecologies.

The majority of paper-based options can be classified as being either multiple-choice or constructed-response. Therefore, in the process of creating an educational drill-and-practice video game, one fundamental question to be answered is which is the most appropriate response format? This paper answers this question, proposing a hybrid format that we call fine-grained multiple-choice, where the player constructs their response one element at a time, with each element chosen from a pre-defined set. A comparative study was conducted with second grade students. When comparing the impact of an educational drill-and-practice video game that uses multiple-choice with one that uses fine-grained multiple-choice, we observe that the fine-grained multiple-choice game achieved better results. However, the multiple-choice game was substantially more successful at capturing the students' interest and motivation. Considering the widespread use of the multiple-choice format in game-based learning activities, as well as in interactive activities, this research suggests rethinking what the most suitable answer format might be for each area of the curriculum and for the different types of games. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","arithmetic practice; constructed-response; drill-and-practice; educational video game; fine-grained multiple-choice; multiple-choice question; Response format","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84966715279"

Although a deeper understanding of gaming ecology on game-based L2 use and learning is necessary to inform the selection and adaptation of digital games for L2 learning and teaching, to date the ecology of digital game-based learning remains underexplored. To address this gap, the present exploratory case study investigated the effect of learners’ L2 proficiency, L2 learner identity, and gaming experience on the use of L2 in-game discourse of six learners of Arabic when playing the simulation-management video game Baalty. Informed by ecological approaches to L2 learning, data collected through questionnaires, think-aloud protocols, observations, walk-throughs, gaming journals, and interviews were analyzed and triangulated. Data analysis revealed that player–game interaction was deeply embedded in the gaming ecology and that learners’ L2 proficiency, L2-learner identities, and gaming experience shaped the L2 learning potential of digital gaming.

Study level/applicability: The case is recommended for undergraduate and graduate courses in the fields of international business and international marketing. The aim is to show students the problems that a family business in the animation industry faces while growing and internationalizing. Specifically, the case discusses the entry mode selection and market selection challenges faced by an emerging market company in the comic book and animation industry to operate overseas and compete with entertainment giants such as Disney and DC Comics. The case enables the instructor to discuss international market selection theories and evaluate entry modes. For graduate students, the international market selection can be further developed by using more robust concepts such as psychic and cultural distance. Case overview: This case examines the trajectory of a pioneering company in the comic book and animation industries, and in the licensing of trademarks in Brazil. Mauricio de Sousa Productions was founded in 1959 and is considered to be one of the most successful cultural producers in the country. According to a leading Brazilian public opinion research agency, 97 per cent of Brazilian children and 96 per cent of their parents are familiar with the Monica and Friends characters. As one of the main players in the publishing market, with 86 per cent of market share, Mauricio de Sousa Productions has a product portfolio that goes beyond Monica and Friends comic strips: the company’s show on the Cartoon Network ranks third in audience viewing in the country and the company has produced animated movies, books, shows and games. However, despite its experience in publishing comic books in several countries, Mauricio de Sousa Productions (MSP)’s worldwide operations have not been as profitable and sustainable as expected. Aiming at expanding its global presence, MSP’s top management decided in 2014 to review the company’s internationalization strategy and operations to enhance the firm’s performance. Expected learning outcomes: The case highlights the key factors facing firms when expanding from an emerging markets. Students are expected to discuss and evaluate options, thus developing their knowledge and decision processes related to family-owned business challenges and opportunities, international market selection theories and international market entry mode. Developing strategies to face challenges as those presented by competitors such as Disney should bring opportunities to students to think outside models and weigh risks. Finally, the case gives students opportunity to base their decision processes and evaluations on logistics problems as well as psychic and cultural distances. It also compels the students to appreciate the various challenges involved in exploiting international market with animation content and intellectual properties as a service.

Most secondary OLPE courses focus on the cognitive pieces of the curriculum, and to a lesser degree, fitness for life due to a lack of research. The omission of the physical, social and emotional components of the OLPE curriculum has created a rift in the understanding, growth and development of students who take these courses. For this reason, Kinesiology professionals need to take a lead in the development of OLPE curricula through efficacious research. Exergaming has shown positive results for each of these four components when played proximally; however, exergames have not been widely studied in remote Internet settings. An exploration of the present need for more research into the ramifications of OLPE and the role Kinesiology professionals can take in guiding this process along with the potential of exergames in OLPE to fill this curricular void is presented. © 2015 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Active video games; E-learning; Exergames; Technology; Virtual education","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84923923837"

Capitalizing on the potential effectiveness of role-playing video games to promote the type of active learning required to increase awareness of and reduce subtle racial bias, we developed the video game Fair Play, in which players take on the role of Jamal, a Black male graduate student in science, who experiences discrimination in his PhD program. We describe a mixed-methods evaluation of the experience of scientific workforce trainers who played Fair Play at the National Institutes of Health Division of Training Workforce Development and Diversity program directors’ meeting in 2013 (n = 47; 76% female, n = 34; 53% nonwhite, n = 26). The evaluation findings suggest that Fair Play can promote perspective taking and increase bias literacy, which are steps toward reducing racial bias and affording Blacks equal opportunities to excel in science. © 2017 The American Society for Cell Biology.","","Female; Humans; Male; Racism; United States; Video Games; female; human; male; racism; United States; video game","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85018309421"

However, the role of students as tutors scaffolding other peers is not normally addressed, since studies are usually focused on the teacher. Moreover, considering the many technologies that can support students’ work nowadays, studies describing specific practices are still needed in order to understand the many possibilities and constraints that can emerge from the use of these tools in the field of education. This exploratory case study aims to extend research on scaffolding between students, presenting data from an ethnographic study where a commercial video game was introduced as part of the curricular activities. Analytically, the scaffolding metaphor is the departing point to describe in detail how the scaffolding process took place, focusing on its purposes and on the role of students as tutors. Our findings reveal how students offered mostly procedural scaffoldings, performing tutor functions such as highlighting relevant features, reducing levels of freedom or controlling the frustration. Results highlight that students can perform scaffolds, and this should be considered as part of the classroom design, making this process visible. Moreover, specific features of the video game enhanced these interactions, which should also be considered when designing game learning environments in the future. © 2016 Association for Information Technology in Teacher Education.","classroom interaction; game-based learning; scaffolding; students as tutors","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84983370829"

One advantage of the Wii is that games can serve as a virtual reality training tool; however, a disadvantage of the Wii is the human-machine interface and the learning effect over multiple trials. The purpose of this study was to assess changes in postural control during Wii gameplay over a series of trials in novice players. Materials and Methods: Thirty-one university athletes (aged 18-25 years) completed four trials of the Nintendo Wii Fit soccer heading (SH) balance game. Center of pressure (COP) was calculated in the anterior-posterior (AP) and medial-lateral (ML) directions for each 70-second time trial at 1000 Hz. COP was assessed using six linear and two nonlinear measures. Repeated measures analysis of variances compared COP measures over the four trials. Results: Significant differences in COP magnitude and velocity were found between trials 1 and 2 in the ML direction. No significant effects of trial were found in the AP direction. In contrast, a measure of the overall area of COP using an ellipse method revealed a significant reduction to COP area between trials 3 and 4. No significant differences between trials were observed in nonlinear measures. Conclusions: These results demonstrate how magnitude and velocity measures of COP control stabilize after the first trial of Wii SH game play in novice young adults. As Wii rehabilitation focuses on individuals with balance difficulties, an important consideration when using the game as an assessment tool is that more than four trials may be required to capture learning in these populations. In addition, contrasting results from ellipse measurement methods point to the use of multiple measures for robust description of COP behavior. This work provides understanding of normative postural control responses with further research in clinical populations needed. © Copyright 2017, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2017.","Balance; Center of pressure; Rehabilitation; Wii","Adolescent; Adult; Evaluation Studies as Topic; Humans; Kinetics; Physical Therapy Modalities; Postural Balance; Pressure; User-Computer Interface; Video Games; Young Adult; adolescent; adult; body equilibrium; computer interface; devices; evaluation study; human; kinetics; physiology; physiotherapy; pressure; utilization; video game; young adult","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85013146737"

The impact of the game on student learning was studied through measurements using 485 students, over one term. Surveys were used to gauge student reception of the game. Pre and post-tests, and in-course examinations were used to quantify student performance. The game was well received with at least 82% of the students that played it recommending it to others. In some cases, game participants outperformed non-participants on course exams. On the final course exam, all of the statistically significant (p<0.05) comparisons (42% of the relevant questions) showed a performance improvement of game participants on the questions, with a maximum grade improvement of 41%. The findings also suggest that some students retain the knowledge obtained from Space Race for at least 7 weeks.

We evaluate the residents׳ opinion of a new laparoscopic simulator for the Nintendo Wii-U platform. Design Prospective questionnaire study. Participants received a standardized introduction and completed level 3 and 4 of the game “Underground.” They filled out a questionnaire concerning demographics and their opinion on realism, usefulness, suitability, haptic feedback, and home training–use of the game. Setting Two tertiary teaching hospitals. Participants Obstetrics and gynaecology residents postgraduate year 1 to 6 (n = 59) from several European countries. Results Subjects (n = 59) were divided into 2 groups based on laparoscopic experience: Group A (n = 38) and Group B (n = 21). The realism of different aspects of the game received mean scores around 3 on a 5-point Likert scale. The hand-eye coordination was regarded most useful for training with a mean of 3.92 (standard deviation 0.93) and the game was considered most suitable for residents in the first part of their postgraduate training with a mean of 3.73 (standard deviation 0.97). Both groups differed especially concerning their opinion of the usefulness of the game as a training tool. Conclusions Most residents liked the new serious game for the Nintendo Wii-U.

This study presents the “Rush for Gold” game using dynamic difficulty adjustment of tasks based on both player performance and affectation inferred through electrodermal activity and facial expressions of the player. The game applies linear regression for calculating playing styles to be applied for achieving a style-based adaptation in other educational video games. Design/methodology/approach: The experimental procedure included subject selection, demonstration, informed consent procedure, two game sessions in random order – one without and another with affective adaptation control – and post-game self-report. The experiment was conducted with participation of 30 master students and university lecturers in informatics. Findings: This study presents experimental results concerning the impact of affective adaptation over playing style recognition, game session time, task’s effectiveness, efficiency and difficulty and, as well, player’s assessment of affectively adaptive gameplay obtained by an adaptation control panel embedded into the game and by post-game self-report. Research limitations/implications: The proposed adaptive game limits recognised styles to such based on the Kolb’s Learning Style Inventory model. Another limitation of the study is the relatively small number of participants constrained by the extended experimental procedure and the desktop game version. Originality/value: The paper presents an original research on the effect of affect-based adaptation on a novel approach for implicit recognition of playing styles. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Adaptation; Affective; Applied games; Game-based learning; Playing styles","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85017006596"

One element included within the philosophy of Sport Education is that of ‘graded competition.’ In graded competition, leagues are arranged that match students of similar skill level against one another, and in some cases, even the game forms are different across the competition levels. To date, there are no studies that have examined the utility of graded competition as promoting either student engagement or learning. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that using graded competition would increase opportunities for game involvement and success rates of both higher and lower skill level students. Participants and setting: The participants in this study were 106 fourth-grade students (51 boys and 55 girls, aged 10–11) from two physical education classes within an elementary school in the southeastern United States. The content was an 18-lesson season of mini-handball taught following the principles of Sport Education. While the overall season format for both classes was the same, the composition of teams varied between the two. In the first class, all teams were heterogeneous with a mix of higher and lower skilled players. These students were able to divide into their sub-teams in any combination they wished. In the second class, two homogeneous leagues were formed; one consisting of teams with all higher skilled students and the other with teams of all lower skilled students. There was no inter-league play. Rather, there were two parallel competitions and two championships. Methods: Digital video records were made of 76 games played during the seasons. Each time a player (a) made contact with the ball (a pass, catch, or interception), (b) was the target of a pass but did not receive it (overthrow or interception), or (c) was involved with a shot on goal (as shooter or goalkeeper), that activity was recorded. A 2 (skill: high/low) × 2 (sex) × 3 (grouping: all low/all high/mixed) full factorial mixed analysis of variance was conducted on the following dependent variables: (a) percent success, (b) ball engagement rate, and (c) efficiency, with the game being the unit of analysis. Findings: The key finding from this study was that in terms of success rates, engagement rates and playing efficiency, lower skilled students seemed to be at a disadvantage when they participated alongside higher skilled classmates. While less severe, there were also decrements in higher skilled student success rates and efficiency in these mixed-skill conditions. By consequence, while higher skilled boys could thrive in either homogenous or mixed level competitions, many girls and all students with lower skill levels benefitted from playing against students of similar skill levels. Conclusions: The grouping of students in terms of skill level has implications for their in-game behaviors, for the extent to which they can develop improved game performance, and potentially for their motivation to persist during play. © 2016 Association for Physical Education.","constraints; elementary school; Handball; physical education; skill levels","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84979084613"

High school-aged participants created the game concept in a three-week workshop, after which assets were assembled and refined by a university-based game design lab. The outcome, Lucidity, was a multimedia game with a nonlinear narrative that led to two different outcomes based on player decisions. The narrative followed the life of one character, an African American woman named Zaria who remembers and grapples with a sexual assault from her past. The player discovers parts of the story by reading comics, watching videos, navigating interactive websites and playing short videogames. The final evaluation consisted of gameplay, a post-game focus group and follow-up interviews. Twenty-four young people participated in three focus group discussions (n = 9, n = 5, n = 10); 23 participated in the follow-up interviews. Salient themes identified in the focus group discussions included: overall approval of the game, the acquisition of new knowledge and minimal past exposure to conversations or education about sexual violence. At follow-up, almost all (n = 22) had initiated a conversation about sexual violence with a parent, peer and/or teacher. Lucidity succeeded in engaging young people and facilitating communication with adults and peers regarding sexual violence and other sexual health topics. Ultimately, a game-based intervention such as this represents a feasible approach for introducing issues of sexual violence, with potential for future implementation in educational settings. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","adolescents; digital media; games; reproductive health; Sexual violence","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84951293449"

Method: Children with typical development (N = 116) and dyslexia (N = 68) participated in computer-based word learning games that assessed word learning in 4 sets of games that manipulated phonological or visuospatial demands. All children were monolingual English-speaking 2nd graders without oral language impairment. The word learning games measured children’s ability to link novel names with novel objects, to make decisions about the accuracy of those names and objects, to recognize the semantic features of the objects, and to produce the names of the novel words. Accuracy data were analyzed using analyses of covariance with nonverbal intelligence scores as a covariate. Results: Word learning deficits were evident for children with dyslexia across every type of manipulation and on 3 of 5 tasks, but not for every combination of task/ manipulation. Deficits were more common when task demands taxed phonology. Visuospatial manipulations led to both disadvantages and advantages for children with dyslexia. Conclusion: Children with dyslexia evidence spoken word learning deficits, but their performance is highly dependent on manipulations and task demand, suggesting a processing trade-off between visuospatial and phonological demands. © 2017 American Speech-Language-Hearing Association.","","Analysis of Variance; Child; Child Language; Decision Making; Dyslexia; Female; Games, Experimental; Humans; Intelligence; Intelligence Tests; Language Tests; Learning; Male; Memory, Short-Term; Phonetics; Recognition (Psychology); Semantics; Space Perception; Video Games; Visual Perception; Vocabulary; analysis of variance; child; decision making; depth perception; dyslexia; female; game; human; intelligence; intelligence test; language development; language test; learning; linguistics; male; phonetics; psychology; recognition; semantics; short term memory; video game; vision","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85017520741"

To provide excellent patient care, nursing students must gain competence in clinical reasoning. Utilising gaming elements and virtual simulations may enhance learning of clinical reasoning. Objectives To investigate nursing students' experiences of learning clinical reasoning process by playing a 3D simulation game. Design Cross-sectional descriptive study. Setting Thirteen gaming sessions at two universities of applied sciences in Finland. The prototype of the simulation game used in this study was single-player in format. The game mechanics were built around the clinical reasoning process. Participants Nursing students from the surgical nursing course of autumn 2014 (N = 166). Methods Data were collected by means of an online questionnaire. Results In terms of the clinical reasoning process, students learned how to take action and collect information but were less successful in learning to establish goals for patient care or to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions. Learning of the different phases of clinical reasoning process was strongly positively correlated. The students described that they learned mainly to apply theoretical knowledge while playing. The results show that those who played digital games daily or occasionally felt that they learned clinical reasoning by playing the game more than those who did not play at all. Conclusion Nursing students' experiences of learning the clinical reasoning process by playing a 3D simulation game showed that such games can be used successfully for learning. To ensure that students follow a systematic approach, the game mechanics need to be built around the clinical reasoning process. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","3D simulation game; Clinical reasoning; Game mechanics; Learning; Nursing students; Playing","Adolescent; Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Education, Nursing; Female; Finland; Humans; Knowledge; Learning; Male; Middle Aged; Problem Solving; Simulation Training; Students, Nursing; Thinking; User-Computer Interface; Video Games; Young Adult; autumn; comparative effectiveness; Finland; human; learning; major clinical study; mechanics; nursing student; patient care; questionnaire; surgical nursing; theoretical model; university; adolescent; adult; computer interface; cross-sectional study; female; knowledge; male; middle aged; nursing education; nursing student; problem solving; procedures; psychology; simulation training; thinking; video game; young adult","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84976298009"

Here, we describe a pilot study assessing the relationships between robotic surgery simulator performance and 3 categories of activities, namely, videogames, musical instruments, and athletics. Design A questionnaire was administered to preclinical medical students for general demographic information and prior experiences in surgery, videogames, musical instruments, and athletics. For follow-up performance studies, we used the Matchboard Level 1 and 2 modules on the da Vinci Skills Simulator, and recorded overall score, time to complete, economy of motion, workspace range, instrument collisions, instruments out of view, and drops. Task 1 was run once, whereas task 2 was run 3 times. Setting All performance studies on the da Vinci Surgical Skills Simulator took place in the Simulation Center at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center. Participants All participants were medical students at the Geisel School of Medicine. After excluding students with prior hands-on experience in surgery, a total of 30 students completed the study. Results We found a significant correlation between athletic skill level and performance for both task 1 (p = 0.0002) and task 2 (p = 0.0009). No significant correlations were found for videogame or musical instrument skill level. Students with experience in certain athletics (e.g., volleyball, tennis, and baseball) tended to perform better than students with experience in other athletics (e.g., track and field). For task 2, which was run 3 times, this association did not persist after the third repetition due to significant improvements in students with low-level athletic skill (levels 0-2). Conclusions Our study suggests that prior experience in high-level athletics, but not videogames or musical instruments, significantly influences surgical proficiency in robot-naive students.

One of the big problems is that getting students’ attention. Since students are huge in numbers, it is not easy to gain the students’ focus of the lesson. The purpose of this study is to describe the challenges and best practices used by Collaborative Teaching (co-teaching) lecturers in gaining students’ attention in immense size classes. There were two Bina Nusantara university lecturers involved in this study. The research method of this study is a descriptive qualitative that scrutinized the findings through self-surveys using interviews and classroom observations. The results of the analysis show that Collaborative Teaching (Co-Teaching) could not be performed well in the immense sizeclasses. One striking factor leading to the ineffectiveness of Collaborative Teaching (Co-teaching) was the big number of students about 200–600 each class that results in an uncontrolled condition of retaining students’ attention. To deal with the obstacles, Co-teaching lecturers reformed the course content performance by using creative demonstration i.e., videos and games, and also developed conducive learning environment by giving proper reward and punishment. Thus, findings of the study will contribute positively to classroom management since it will supply positive and constructive apprehensions for lecturers encountered managing large class problems. Likewise, students of the large classes would understand the lesson better. © 2016 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.","Attention-Getting; Collaborative teaching (Co-Teaching); Immense classes","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85011984649"

Study level/applicability: Graduate level. Case overview: This case, based on field research and multiple secondary sources, documents the 12-month period since early 2014 during which Cricket South Africa (CSA) developed the Protea Fire brand for their national men’s cricket team, known as the Proteas. In mid-2014, Marc Jury, the Commercial and Marketing manager of CSA set up a project team to take the previously in-house Protea Fire brand public. With the 2015 Cricket World Cup in Australia and New Zealand less than a year away, Jury worked with a diverse project team of Proteas players, cricket brand managers and external consultants to build a public brand identity for the national team, to nurture greater fan affinity and to mobilize South Africans behind their team for the World Cup. The project team developed a range of Protea Fire multimedia content as the core of the campaign. These included video diaries, scripts which were written by the Proteas players themselves, player profile videos, motivational team-talk videos and good luck video messages featuring ordinary and famous South Africans. Having invested in creating this content, the project team faced the difficult task of allocating a limited media budget to broadcast and amplify the content. Another significant challenge was to ensure that the Proteas team values were authentically communicated across all content, including via the social media strategy using Twitter, Instagram and YouTube. As the World Cup tournament kicked off on February 14th 2015, South Africa was well placed to overcome their previous inability to reach a final, although Jury wondered whether another exit in the knockout round would weaken the strong and positive emotions the Protea Fire campaign had ignited. With the last two balls remaining in South Africa’s semi-final game against New Zealand on March 24th 2015, and the home team requiring just five runs to win, Jury joined 60 million South Africans hoping that Protea Fire was strong enough. The case concludes with South Africa losing the semi-final game and Jury turning his attention to how the #ProteaFire campaign should respond. Expected learning outcomes: This study aimed to analyse the development of a sport team brand and a megaevent campaign; to assess the efficiency and effectiveness of a marketing campaign; and to consider appropriate brand responses to the team’s failure to deliver on expectations.

Tablets support educational activities such as archiving, word processing, and generation of academic products. They also connect with the Internet, providing access to news, encyclopaedic entries, and e-books. In addition, tablets have the potential to provide immediate entertainment, such as games, social contacts, and videos. The impact of iPads in schools is widespread, and may among many other things change both formal and informal learning during break-time periods such as breaks and lunch in pre-school, primary, and lower secondary education. The inclination to converse or interact with people nearby may diminish considerably if desired information or entertainment is only a click (or swipe) away. The present qualitative research involved interviews of 10 pupils from three schools in the Copenhagen area to explore their subjective experiences of the impact of the municipally endorsed distribution of iPads for student use during break-time. The findings of this exploratory study suggest that there are significant differences in experiences by age group. The study suggests that schools help pupils adopt the kind of technological literacy that will still allow them to engage in socio-emotional learning during break-time. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","break-time; iPad; primary school; self-regulatory behaviour; socio-emotional learning","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85020381084"

We extended this prior research by examining the effects of dynamically changing temperature on various aspects of performance in a video game task. In the span of approximately an hour, temperature was gradually increased, stayed constant for a period of time, and gradually decreased to baseline. The gaming task was a variation on one used to assess impulsivity in participants thus allowing the possibility of assessing the effects of temperature on impulsive choice. Rather than heat increasing impulsivity and thus decreasing wait times, participants showed increases in wait times as temperature increased which either suggests that participants were becoming more self-controlled under heat or that the documented negative impact of heat on motor functioning was dominating their performance.

Serious games should also be considered as an alternative pedagogical medium for attracting students with different needs and expectations. In this field study, we empirically examined different forms of serious-game use for learning on learning performance and attitudes of eighty 13-year-old students in the first grade of middle school. Divided into four groups of 20 students, each group practiced with a maths video game in three ways. The first group played the storytelling maths game, the second played the same game but with no story and the third played and modified the video game. Finally, a control group practised in a paper-based (traditional) way by solving exercises. Although only minor differences in learning performance were identified, we found significant differences in the attitudes of the students toward learning through the video game. Students who are not motivated by conventional paper-based assignments might be engaged better with the use of a video game. Our findings suggest that video game pedagogy could provide malleable learning for different groups of students using methods that move beyond the conventional tool-based approach.

Personalization allows for understanding of domain principles to be grounded in concrete and familiar experiences. By making connections to prior knowledge, personalization may reduce extraneous cognitive load, freeing up resources for the acquisition of new ideas. However, issues with adding seductive details that may distract learners, as well as mismatch between in-school and out-of-school mathematics, must be critically considered when designing for personalized learning. We review the research on personalization in mathematics, interpreting conflicting results by highlighting key cognitive considerations. Personalization can be implemented at radically different levels of depth, grain size, and ownership. We give an extended example of a promising intervention for personalized learning, drawing from research on problem-posing in algebra. We argue that interventions designed to draw upon students’ experiences with quantities have potential to enhance learning. However, when the complex, situated experiences of students are mathematized, there is a tension between preserving the authenticity of their experience, and accomplishing desired mathematical goals. © 2017, FIZ Karlsruhe.","Contextual grounding; Everyday math; Personalization; Personalized learning","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85025478638"

Using a validated instrument, participants were divided into four groups based on their gaming preferences: (1) Well-rounded (WR) gamers, who play all types of games often; (2) Hardcore players, who frequently tend to play first-person shooter (FPS) and sports games; (3) Casual players, who play moderately and tend to play music, social, and puzzle games; and (4) Non-gamers, who barely play videogames at all. Among all of the participants' personal factors (age, gender, and type of player) that were measured, only gaming preferences seemed to have a significant (p<.05) positive influence on students' interest in theater-going. Neither age nor gender seemed to affect the outcomes. Casual and Well-rounded gamers scored higher in the game than Non-gamers and Hardcore players. Due to these results, we also explored whether the gaming profile affected traditional educational approaches. Traditional education worked better than videogames only for students who do not usually play videogames. This study suggests that gaming preferences may influence the effectiveness of different educational approaches. Knowing students' gaming preferences in advance may help educators find the best educational approach for each student. © 2017 IEEE.","applied games; Computer uses in education; computers and society; digital humanities; educational videogames; learning technologies; videogames on arts","Computer games; Education; Human computer interaction; Interactive computer graphics; Serious games; Social sciences; Computer uses in education; Computers and societies; Digital humanities; Learning technology; Video game; Students","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85028355642"

The results of pre-, post- and delayed tests showed that students that had access to the contents via the video game performed statistically better in the short run, found the materials more appealing and believed their vocabulary skills had developed further than those in the control group. However, the regression model showed that the actual enjoyment of the game seemed to have no effect on the students' learning outcomes, neither according to their own estimation nor as determined by testing.

Students had to play an educational videogame where players need to collect and retrieve information chunks about the function of power plants. They were randomly assigned to one cell of a 2 (low vs. high difficulty) x 2 (with or without penalties) between-subjects design. Data on retention knowledge, detail knowledge, learning efficiencies and goal orientations were collected. Results show that players with penalties scored higher on retention tests than players without penalties, whereas detail knowledge is enhanced by a low difficulty in contrast to a high difficulty. In addition, students with penalties learned and recalled the presented knowledge more efficient. An explorative analysis of goal orientations revealed influences of individual dispositions on affective responses and positive correlations with performance goals.

We explored whether enacting words at encoding, relative to simply reading them, provided protection against the detrimental effects of a degraded retrieval experience, through the addition of motor processing to the extant memory representation. Participants encoded a mixed list of enacted and read words, then completed Test 1, and a later Test 2. Encoding and Test 2 were always completed under full attention (FA). Critically though, Test 1 was completed either under FA, or under divided attention (DA) with a distracting task requiring semantic and phonological processing. We predicted a larger enactment effect following DA relative to FA, indicating greater preservation of enacted words from dual-task interference. In Experiment 1, we demonstrated that the enactment effect was indeed larger following DA than FA, indicating greater preservation of enacted words after dual-task interference. In Experiment 2, we showed that this effect was even more potent over longer time scales, which served as a conceptual replication. In Experiment 3, we showed that enactment provides little to no protection when the distracting task requires motor processing, and in Experiment 4, we returned to the phonological distracting task and showed that in contrast with enactment, generation at encoding does not afford the same protection to memory. Taken together, these finding suggest that enactment renders words relatively immune to the detrimental effects of dual-tasking during testing, through the addition of a different kind, rather than a greater degree, of processing to the memory trace at encoding. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Consolidation; Divided attention; Enactment; Memory; Representation","Adolescent; Adult; Attention; Female; Humans; Male; Memory; Memory and Learning Tests; Reaction Time; Recognition (Psychology); Young Adult; adult; Article; attention; clinical article; dual-task performance (test); enactment; female; human; human experiment; information retrieval; male; measurement accuracy; memory consolidation; nervous system parameters; neuroprotection; normal human; priority journal; recall; recognition; response time; undergraduate student; video game; adolescent; cognition assessment; memory; physiology; reaction time; young adult","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85017145627"

Serious games create opportunities to develop this competency, which can be used as a self-directed learning strategy to complement existing didactic learning and simulation-based strategies. Aim To describe the development and evaluation of a serious game to improve nursing students' knowledge, confidence, and performance in blood transfusion. Method An experiential gaming model was applied to guide the design of the serious game environment. A clustered, randomized controlled trial was conducted with 103 second-year undergraduate nursing students who were randomized into control or experimental groups. After a baseline evaluation of the participants' knowledge and confidence on blood transfusion procedure, the experimental group undertook a blood transfusion serious game and completed a questionnaire to evaluate their learning experience. All participants' clinical performances were evaluated in a simulated environment. Results The post-test knowledge and confidence mean scores of the experimental group improved significantly (p < 0.001) after the serious game intervention compared to pre-test mean scores and to post-test mean scores of the control group (p < 0.001). However, no significance difference (p = 0.11) was found between the experimental and control groups on the post-test performance mean scores. The participants evaluated the serious game positively. Conclusion The study provided evidence on the effectiveness of a serious game in improving the knowledge and confidence of nursing students on blood transfusion practice. The features of this serious game could be further developed to incorporate additional scenarios with repetitive exercises and feedback to enhance the impact on clinical performance. Given the flexibility, practicality, and scalability of such a game, they can serve as a promising approach to optimize learning when blended with high-fidelity simulation. © 2017","Blood transfusion; Nursing education; Patient safety; Serious game; Simulation","Blood Transfusion; Clinical Competence; Computer-Assisted Instruction; Education, Nursing, Baccalaureate; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Male; Patient Safety; Problem-Based Learning; Program Evaluation; Students, Nursing; Surveys and Questionnaires; Video Games; Young Adult; blood transfusion; comparative effectiveness; control group; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; exercise; experimental model; female; human; human experiment; learning; male; nursing education; nursing student; patient safety; pretest posttest design; questionnaire; randomized controlled trial; simulation; task performance; attitude to health; blood transfusion; clinical competence; nursing education; problem based learning; procedures; program evaluation; standards; teaching; video game; young adult","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85019183645"

One reason for this may be children's less developed hazard perception skills. We assume that children's situation awareness could be trained with a computer based learning game, which should also improve their hazard perception skills. In this paper, we present a prototype for such a game and pilot it with 8–9 year old children. The game consisted of videos filmed from a bicyclist's perspective. Using a touchscreen, the player's task was to point out targets early enough to gain points. The targets were either overt (other visible road users on a potentially conflicting course) or covert (occlusions, i.e. locations where other road users could suddenly emerge). If a target was missed or identified too late, the video was paused and feedback was given. The game was tested with 49 children from the 2nd grade of primary school (aged 8–9). 31 young adults (aged 22–34) played the game for comparison. The effect of the game on situation awareness was assessed with situation awareness tests in a crossover design. Similar videos were used in the tests as in the game, but instead of pointing out the targets while watching, the video was suddenly masked and participants were asked to locate all targets which had been present just before the masking, choosing among several possible locations. Their performance was analyzed using Signal Detection Theory and answer latencies. The game decreased answer latency and marginally changed response bias in a less conservative direction for both children and adults, but it did not significantly increase sensitivity for targets. Adults performed better in the tests and in the game, and it was possible to satisfactorily predict group membership based on the scores. Children found it especially difficult to find covert targets. Overall, the described version of the learning game cannot be regarded as an effective tool for situation awareness/hazard perception training, but ways to improve the game are discussed. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Anticipation; Children; Hazard perception; Serious game; Situation awareness","Accidents, Traffic; Adolescent; Adult; Awareness; Bicycling; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Humans; Male; Perception; Video Games; Young Adult; Education; Hazards; Personnel training; Roads and streets; Signal detection; Anticipation; Children; Hazard perceptions; Serious games; Situation awareness; adolescent; adult; awareness; child; cycling; education; female; human; male; perception; physiology; preschool child; prevention and control; traffic accident; video game; young adult; Computer games","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84997708071"

This incremental nature of learning poses an important problem: it is usually unclear whether a sequence of stimuli consists of only a single pattern, or multiple patterns that are spliced together. In the former case, the learner can directly use each observed stimulus to continuously revise its representation of the task environment. In the latter case, however, the learner must first parse the sequence of stimuli into different bundles, so as to not conflate the multiple patterns. We created a video-game statistical learning paradigm and investigated (1) whether learners without prior knowledge of the existence of multiple “stimulus bundles” — subsequences of stimuli that define locally coherent statistical patterns — could detect their presence in the input and (2) whether learners are capable of constructing a rich representation that encodes the various statistical patterns associated with bundles. By comparing human learning behavior to the predictions of three computational models, we find evidence that learners can handle both tasks successfully. In addition, we discuss the underlying reasons for why the learning of stimulus bundles occurs even when such behavior may seem irrational. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Bayesian nonparametric models; Implicit learning; Incremental learning; Memory; Sequential input; Stimulus bundles","Bayes Theorem; Cues; Humans; Memory; Models, Psychological; Pattern Recognition, Visual; Probability Learning; Reaction Time; Article; behavior; controlled study; human; human experiment; intuition; learning; learning environment; normal human; priority journal; recognition; stimulus; video game; association; Bayes theorem; memory; pattern recognition; psychological model; reaction time","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84987932343"

This modern culture we say, “Network Sociaety” (Castells, 2006) or “digital narrative” (Jenkins, 2006) game play was largely a social experience, and they explained the pleasure of gaming as largely one of socializing with friends. Other groups (Kurt, 2011) say that gaming describes from personal experience numerous video games and the relationships they have created with learners. In addition to their commercial popularity, digital games have captured the attention of training professionals and educators. There are several reasons for this professional interest. First, there has been a major shift in the field of learning from a traditional, didactic model of instruction to a learner-centered model that emphasizes a more active learner role. This article represents a shift away from “learning by listening” model of instruction to one in which students “learning by gaming”. In accordance with firts part of this article, have been discussed what is game/gaming within digital culture and digital age. New digital technologies provide opportunities to create learning environments that actively involve students in problemsolving. Video games is that some empirical evidence exists that games can be effective tools for enhancing learning and understanding of complex subject matter. Second part of this article, purpose to explain game based learning. Morover in this part to be claimed instructional model as a technology-assisted learning method. Accordingly, purpose of this article is to present and elaborate a model of instructional games and learning. The goal is to examine the unique aspects of games that can enhance learning. Discussion addresses the application of this approach to the design and implementation of effective training games. Instructional games are primarily seen as a means to enhance intrinsic motivation, extrinsic motivation is also important. The goal is to develop learners who are self-directed and self-motivated, both because the activity is interesting in itself and because achieving the outcome is important.

The serious game innovatively incorporates evidence-based HF guidelines with contemporary game technology. Materials and Methods: The study included three phases: development of the game prototype, its usability assessment, and evaluation of the game's functionality. Usability testing included researchers' usability assessment, followed by research personnel's observations of participants playing the game, and participants' completion of a usability survey. Next, in a pretest-post-test design, validated instruments - the Atlanta Heart Failure Knowledge Tet and the Self Care for Heart Failure Index - were used to measure improvement in HF self-management knowledge and behaviors related to HF self-maintenance, self-management, and self-efficacy, respectively. A postgame survey assessed participants' perceptions of the game. Results: During usability testing, with seven participants, 100%, 100%, and 86% found the game easy to play, enjoyable, and helpful for learning about HF, respectively. In the subsequent functionality testing, with 19 participants, 89% found the game interesting, enjoyable, and easy to play. Playing the game resulted in a significant improvement in HF self-management knowledge, a nonsignificant improvement in self-reported behaviors related to HF self-maintenance, and no difference in HF self-efficacy scores. Participants with lower education level and age preferred games to any other medium for receiving information. Conclusion: It is feasible to develop a serious digital game that community-dwelling older adults with HF find both satisfying and acceptable and that can improve their self-management knowledge. © 2016 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.","Games; Heart failure; Self-management","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Diet, Sodium-Restricted; Feasibility Studies; Female; Heart Failure; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Mobile Applications; Patient Compliance; Patient Satisfaction; Pleasure; Program Evaluation; Self Care; Self Efficacy; Surveys and Questionnaires; Symptom Assessment; User-Computer Interface; Video Games; aged; computer interface; feasibility study; female; heart failure; human; male; middle aged; mobile application; patient compliance; patient satisfaction; pleasure; program evaluation; psychology; questionnaire; self care; self concept; sodium restriction; symptom assessment; very elderly; video game","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85006434576"

Participants and Methods: A total of 22 Chinese primary school children were recruited and interviewed. Four AVGs (Wii Boxing, Wii Fit™ Plus Obstacle Run ; EyeToy Knockout , EyeToy Keep ups ) from two commercial consoles (Nintendo® Wii™ and Sony PlayStation® 2 EyeToy® ) were employed. Participants used four selected AVGs for 3 minutes each. After each play period, children (1) described the strengths and weaknesses of each game as well as rated the attractive features of each game based on a 16-item questionnaire and (2) rated up to 5 items that were most influential regarding their AVG preferences. Results: Participants indicated that control was the most significant feature, followed by feedback, goal, and graphics. The top five rated features imply that the perception of competence was the most appealing aspect and expected outcome of Chinese children who play AVGs. Conclusions: Compared with the Western findings regarding attractive AVG features, the present study found certain similarities as well as significant differences among Chinese AVG players. Based on the present study, control, feedback, goal, and graphics are the most significant features that attract Chinese children to play AVGs. Physical exertion, social interaction, competition, and learning outcomes, which are valued according to Western studies, were not mentioned as significant features by Chinese children.

Design: Cross-sectional survey. Materials and Methods: Online survey of therapists in Canada who were members of 1 of 26 professional PT or OT colleges or associations using the Assessing Determinants Of Prospective Take-up of Virtual Reality (ADOPT-VR2) Instrument. Results: We received 1071 (506 PTs, 562 OTs, 3 dual-trained) responses. Forty-six percent had clinical VR/AVG experience; only 12% reported current use, with the Wii being the most clinically accessible (41%) system. Therapists used VR/AVGs primarily in rehabilitation (32%) and hospital (29%) settings, preferentially targeting balance (39.3%) and physical activity (19.8%) outcomes. Stroke (25.8%), brain injury (15.3%), musculoskeletal (14.9%), and cerebral palsy (10.5%) populations were most frequently treated. Therapists with VR/AVG experience rated all ADOPT-VR2 constructs more highly than did those without experience (P < 0.001). Factors predictive of intention to use VR included the technology's perceived usefulness and therapist self-efficacy in VR/AVG use (P < 0.001). Highest-rated barriers to VR/AVG use were lack of funds, space, time, support staff, and appropriate clients, whereas facilitators included client motivation, therapist knowledge, and management support. Most (76%) respondents were interested in learning more. Conclusion: Understanding use, predictors of use, and learning needs is essential for developing knowledge translation initiatives to support clinical integration of VR/AVGs.

The purpose of this study is to conduct a systematic review to have an in-depth investigation into the existing gamification solutions targeted at solving user engagement problems in different categories of software. We carried out this systematic review by proposing a framework of gamifying process, which is the basis for comparison of existing gamification solutions. In order to report the review, the primary studies are categorized according to the following: a) gamified software and their platforms; b) elements of the gamifying process; c) gamification solutions in each software type; d) gamification solutions for software user engagement problems; e) gamification solutions in general; and f) effects of gamification on software user engagement and performance. Based on the search procedure and criteria, a total of 78 primary studies were extracted. Most of the studies focused on educational and social software, which were developed for web or mobile platforms. We concluded that the number of studies on motivating users to use software content, solving problems in learning software, and using real identity is very limited. Furthermore, few studies have been carried out on gamifying the following software categories: productivity software, cloud storage, utility software, entertainment software, search engine software, tool software, fitness software, software engineering, information worker software, and health-care software. In addition, a large number of gamification solutions are relatively simple and require improvement. Thus, for future studies, researchers can work on the items discovered in this review; they can improve the quality of the current gamified systems by using a wide variety of game mechanics and interface elements, utilizing a combination of contextual types of rewards and giving users the ability to use received rewards “in-game” and “out-game.” © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","","Human computer interaction; Problem solving; Search engines; Software engineering; Utility programs; Information workers; Interface elements; Learning software; Productivity softwares; Search procedures; Software contents; Systematic Review; Utility software; C (programming language)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84973091487"

Methods: A 5-week MOOC on behavioral medicine was hosted on the edX platform. The authors developed two branched virtual patients consisting of video recordings of a live standardized patient, with multiple clinical decision points and narration unfolding depending on learners' choices. Students interacted with the virtual patients to treat stress and sleep problems. Answers to the exit survey and participant comments from the discussion forum were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. Results: In total, 19,236 participants enrolled in the MOOC, out of which 740 received the final certificate. The virtual patients were completed by 2317 and 1640 participants respectively. Among survey respondents (n = 442), 83.1% agreed that the virtual patient exercise was helpful. The qualitative analysis resulted in themes covering what it was like to work with the virtual patient, with subthemes on learner-centered education, emotions/eustress, game comparisons, what the participants learned, what surprised them, how confident participants felt about applying interventions in practice, suggestions for improvement, and previous experiences of virtual patients. Conclusions: Students were enthusiastic about interacting with the virtual patients as a means to apply new knowledge about behavioral medicine interventions. The most common suggestion was to incorporate more interactive cases with various levels of complexity. Further research should include patient outcomes and focus on interprofessional aspects of learning with virtual patients in a MOOC. © 2017 The Author(s).","Behavioral medicine; Case-based learning; Evaluation; MOOC; Qualitative content analysis; Virtual patient","Adult; Behavioral Medicine; Education, Distance; Education, Medical; Humans; Qualitative Research; Simulation Training; Students, Medical; Virtual Reality; adult; behavioral medicine; education; human; medical education; medical student; procedures; qualitative research; simulation training; virtual reality","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85030693350"

Nevertheless, teachers might face several barriers that dissuade them from using educational video games in their courses. This study analyses factors affecting teachers´ behavioural intention to use educational video games in their courses using a Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) approach. The research model is tested via structural equation modelling (SEM) on a sample of 312 teachers in Higher Education institutions. Results suggest that perceived usefulness influences in a direct and positive way teachers’ intention to use educational video games. Results also suggest that perceived ease of use indirectly influence intentions through perceived usefulness. Age was found to moderate the effect of teachers’ perceived ease of use on perceived usefulness of EVGs.

We conducted two studies to examine the effectiveness of different feedback design (timing, duration, repeats, and feedback source) in a serious game designed to teach learners about cognitive biases. We also compared the digital game-based learning condition to a professional training video. Overall, the digital game was significantly more effective than the video condition. Longer durations and repeats improve the effects on bias-mitigation. Surprisingly, there was no significant difference between just-in-time feedback and delayed feedback, and computer-generated feedback was more effective than feedback from other players.

This raises difficulties in engaging students in real-life decision-making quandaries where military necessity meets legalism, as well as fundamental ethical questions about the use of realistic, yet explicit, imagery in the classroom. The School of Law at Queen’s University Belfast has developed a series of innovative computer scenarios based on the Arma 3 open world tactical war simulator. A variety of formative scenarios (addressing issues such as cluster munitions and landmines) were developed to familiarise the students with the factual scenario and the computer technology. Subsequently, students engaged in a summative assessment to test their legal understanding in the face of increasingly challenging conflict situations, in particular grey zones where legal argument can justify seemingly morally wrongful acts during war. This paper examines both the learning objectives of this project, and the project development cycle – from the initial proposal to its implementation in class, as well as positing the benefits and drawbacks in integrating technology and games into the legal teaching environment, reflecting on the emerging and traditional pedagogy in this area. © 2017 The Association of Law Teachers.","International humanitarian law; Multiple intelligences; Technology; Video games","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85027139652"

However, it was launched only in 2010, and the authors intended to ascertain the values of the heads of preschool child care institutions, teachers and parents as well as their conception of value education. The national programme was updated as ""Values Development in Estonian Society 2015-2020"" (Ministry of Education and Research 2015). In 2015, the researchers aimed to investigate if and how values of teachers of child care institutions and their conception of value education had changed. The sample in 2010 included nine respondents related to preschool child care institutions: Three heads, three teachers, and three parents. The 2015 sample included 10 teachers. The research was conducted by using a qualitative method, which included semi-structured interviews and video observations of activities that teachers carried out with children. In 2010 and 2015, the values were said to be incorporated in general curricular goals and topics of the year. In 2010, the teachers said that values were not separately designated in the kindergarten curriculum; however, they were incorporated into the curriculum. They did not teach values as a separate discipline; values were highlighted in various activities and situation games. In 2015, it was mentioned that value education was consciously included in activities proceeding from the relevant schooling and education domain and the topic of the week. It may be said that in 2010 value education related topics had not been sufficiently introduced in kindergartens yet. Based on interviews and video observations conducted in 2015, it could be claimed that educators would benefit from a more deliberate approach to value education. © 2017 by Pärje Ülavere.","learning and upbringing methods; preschool child care institution; value education; values","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85021317822"

In this study, we test the possibility that different sorts of video games may have different effects, on different types of creativity; or none at all. Three games were tested, including a sandbox and a puzzle game (Minecraft and Portal 2), and creativity was measured by the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking (TTCT). The games were hound to have different effects, and on only some measures. We discuss possible accounts for these results, and offer practical suggestions to better control such studies in future. The strongest and most surprising result was that one particular form of creativity, flexibility, was affected much more than others.

This qualitative, grounded theory study purports an interpretive understanding of the experiences of 13 Australian teachers who have used immersive digital games (IDGs) in the classroom. These teachers participated in in-depth, semi-structured interviews that were one to two hours in duration. A key finding of this study is that teachers who use IDGs in the classroom can experience varying degrees of alienation from their teaching colleagues. This paper presents a model of the process of ‘Feeling Alienated’ experienced by some educators using IDGs in their classrooms. It begins with ‘the lone believer’ teacher who has strong beliefs in the value of using IDGs for student learning. Resentment by some colleagues, curriculum and classroom concerns, and insufficient advocacy contribute to the lone believer feeling alienated. This leads the lone believer to minimise the impact of their use of IDGs. The study concludes that, whilst negative teacher attitudes towards the use of IDGs in the classroom persist, the potential impact of IDGs in the classroom will not be fully realised. © 2017 Association for Information Technology in Teacher Education.","elementary education; Game-based learning; pedagogical issues; secondary education; video games","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85020527547"

As part of a design-based research project to design, test, and evaluate an online 3D simulation game for use in game-based simulation in healthcare education, the present study applied Kolb’s experiential learning theory to investigate nursing students’ experiential learning processes during a 3D simulation game. The data, collected from eight nursing students, comprised audio and video recordings from gaming sessions and focus group interviews. The results indicate that in 3D simulation game, patient-related experiences were supported by audiovisual authenticity, the authenticity of scenarios, and interactivity. Feedback triggered students to reflect on their own learning processes. Students conceptualised knowledge by applying nursing theory, and they internalised procedures that can be used in real life. They also had an opportunity to experiment by exploring and making decisions in the gaming environment.

The results show that exergaming over the Internet can provide students with a social experience that results in increased relatedness between participants versus playing by themselves against a non-player character (NPC). This relatedness can help students access the social standards for physical education when enrolled in OLPE. © 2015 The Author(s).","Active video games; E-learning; Student interaction","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84996563076"

Video games are increasingly recognized as important consumer products, literacy and learning tools, and objects of scholarly research. This study aims to explore video game information needs and game organization behaviour of users, especially focusing on understanding differences by sex and age. This is important for designing useful video game information retrieval and recommendation systems. Method. A large-scale survey of game players and other stakeholders interested in video games was conducted by the research team. The survey asked about their gaming experience, information seeking, and game collecting and organization behaviour. Analysis. Responses were tabulated and descriptive statistics are reported. Chi-squaredgoodness-of-fit tests were also performed in order to determine whether the discrepancies between sexes and age groups were statistically significant. Results. The survey results are presented, focusing on how users organize their game collections, what kinds of game information they value and from which information sources they seek such information. The differences based on sex and age group are also discussed. Conclusions. The findings suggest that users do exhibit different information needs and seek different game information resources to meet those needs based on their sex and age, implying the importance of developing game information systems flexible enough to serve a wide variety of game users. © the author, 2015.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85000716009"

In broad terms, this purpose is tantamount to the stated purpose of Swedish PE in national steering documents. Crum contends, however, that physical educators do not prioritise learning, which is largely due to the different ‘movement cultures’ that constitute the PE lessons. This article explores how practice unfolds in movement cultures that are included in Swedish PE and their implications for teaching and learning in the subject. Some 30 (indoor) PE lessons in eight secondary schools in four cities throughout Sweden were video recorded. At ‘first glance’ these lessons indicated the prevalence of four logics of practice: a physical training logic, a sports logic, a sport technique logic and a dance logic. However, further analysis revealed that the teachers' and students' actions were not entirely in line with a logic of practice of training the body, winning the game, learning sporting skills or learning to dance. Instead, the PE practice largely unfolded as a ‘looks-like-practice’, where the purpose of teaching was blurred, and where any ‘planned introduction into movement culture’ was difficult to identify. In the final section, the authors discuss how physical activity logics can be recontextualised in a PE setting in order to emphasise the educational contribution of PE. © 2015 The Author(s).

Since the emergence of this educational trend, called digital game-based learning, several studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect that learning or recreational video games have had on learners and on their mastery of learning objectives. Many of these studies have focused on specific sets of skills that specific video games can promote. Nevertheless, there is evidence that any type of video game, regardless of its learning or recreational nature, can help students develop certain knowledge, skills, and attitudes (KSAs) that could be useful for engineering courses and projects. This evidence also suggests that digital game-based learning contributes to 21st-century skills that are necessary for competitive engineering professionals. This literature review will describe the KSAs that could be promoted in constructivist-oriented classrooms when learners engage in any type of video game. This research paper will focus on how engineering students can develop 21st-century KSAs that are implicit in each gaming opportunity, such as high-order thinking and decision-making skills, persistence, socialization, leadership skills, self-confidence, and autonomy and self-regulation. © 2013 IEEE.","attitudes; constructivism; digital game-based learning; engineering education; knowledge; skills; video games","Computer games; Computer graphics; Decision making; E-learning; Education; Education computing; Engineering education; Human computer interaction; Interactive computer graphics; Teaching; attitudes; constructivism; Digital game-based learning; knowledge; skills; Video game; Students","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84946741292"

These new tools include multiple types of computer software and hardware to include (video) games. The purpose of this study was to examine and compare the effect of computer learning games in the form of three-dimensional serious educational games, two-dimensional online laboratories, and traditional lecture-based instruction in the context of student content learning in science. In particular, this study examines the impact of dimensionality, or the ability to move along the X-, Y-, and Z-axis in the games. Study subjects (N = 551) were randomly selected using a stratified sampling technique. Independent strata subsamples were developed based upon the conditions of serious educational games, online laboratories, and lecture. The study also computationally models a potential mechanism of action and compares two- and three-dimensional learning environments. F test results suggest a significant difference for the main effect of condition across the factor of content gain score with large effect. Overall, comparisons using computational models suggest that three-dimensional serious educational games increase the level of success in learning as measured with content examinations through greater recruitment and attributional retraining of cognitive systems. The study supports assertions in the literature that the use of games in higher dimensions (i.e., three-dimensional versus two-dimensional) helps to increase student understanding of science concepts. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Cognition; Computational models; Online simulations; Serious educational games","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84955186514"

However, interactivity does not always lead to greater self-efficacy. Important constructs in social cognitive theory, such as performance outcome and perceived similarity, are often not accounted for in studies that have tested the effect of digital game interactivity on self-efficacy. This study assessed the effects of interactive digital games compared with passive digital games based on video comparison, a common experimental design used to test the effect of digital game interactivity on self-efficacy. In addition, this study also evaluated player performance and measured perceived similarity to the observed player. Findings suggested that in general, digital game interactivity predicted higher self-efficacy compared with noninteractive passive games. However, in the noninteractive conditions, the effects of performance on self-efficacy were moderated by perceived similarity between the observer and the observed player. When the observed player was perceived to be similar to the observer, the effects of performance on self-efficacy were comparable to the interactive game, but when the observed player was perceived as dissimilar to the observer, observing the dissimilar player failed to increase observer self-efficacy.

Current simulation-based approaches to teach NTS are challenged when learners have to master NTS concepts, clinically challenging situations, and simulation as a complex technique. The combination of all three aspects might overwhelm learners. To facilitate the deeper comprehension of NTS concepts, we describe an innovative video-based game, the Non-Technical Skills (NTS) Bingo. Participants get NTS Bingo cards that show five NTS elements each. While observing (non-medical) video clips, they try to find examples for the elements on their cards, typically observable behaviours that match a given element. After the video, participants “defend” their solution in a discussion with the game leader and other players. This discussion and the reflection aim to deepen the processing of the NTS concepts. We provide practical guidance for the conduct of NTS Bingo, including a selection of usable video clips and tips for the facilitated discussion after a clip. We use NTS in anaesthesia as example and provide guidance on how to adapt NTS Bingo to other disciplines. NTS Bingo is based on theoretical considerations on concept learning, which we describe to support the rationale for its conduct. © 2016, The Author(s).","Cognitive psychology; Concept learning; Gaming; Non-technical skills","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85073578202"

The plethora of online interactive digital materials, including digital games, allows users to react and interact in theoretical environments far beyond the users' immediate surroundings. It has been theorized that this technological and cultural revolution, now deeply rooted in the childhoods of younger students, has produced a profound shift not only in the ways modern students acquire, master, and utilize knowledge, but also in their expectations from those delivering that learning. To parallel the more interactive and engaging digital content available to students outside of the classroom, multimedia learning tools can assist and help motivate students by supplementing traditional teaching modalities with learner-centered learning, through application and practice. The overall effectiveness of multimedia learning has been documented (Son & Simonian, 2013; Son & Goldstone, 2012; Zhang, 2005). How are effective multimedia learning tools best integrated into the instruction of challenging courses, such as mathematics and economics courses? Our answer to this question involves a two-step analytical process. First, we present an Integrated Multimedia Learning Model which overcomes some of the crucial weaknesses of the traditional face-to-face learning model. Then, we then test our hypothesis about the effectiveness of an Integrated Multimedia Learning Model through an examination of the outcomes of both learning models in college economics classes. In sum, we find that students who were presented with complex material through an Integrated Multimedia Learning Model achieved statistically higher performances than students who were presented the same complex material through a traditional-learning model.

We present our virtual learning environment StudentResearcher, which incorporates simulations, multiple-choice quizzes, video lectures, and gamification into a learning path for quantum mechanics at the advanced university level. StudentResearcher is built upon the experiences gathered from workshops with the citizen science game Quantum Moves at the high-school and university level, where the games were used extensively to illustrate the basic concepts of quantum mechanics. The first test of this new virtual learning environment was a 2014 course in advanced quantum mechanics at Aarhus University with 47 enrolled students.

Students taking online physical education (OLPE) at home may lack opportunities for competitive or cooperative physical activity that are available to students in a traditional setting. Active video games (exergames) can be played over the internet between students. Exergames allow for a new and possibly effective genre of physical activity that offers OLPE students the opportunity to interact in relevant, engaging, and entertaining physical activity with other students. Secondary student (N=124) heart rates were recorded before exergaming, after playing a non-player character, and after playing another student remotely over the internet. The results show that exergaming between students over the internet can raise student heart rates to moderate levels of physical intensity commensurate with guidelines for Physical Intensity for secondary students. Exergames show promise for physical activity in an OLPE course when played against a non-player character and a remote partner.

Nevertheless, these benefits have not been proved sufficiently for some domains, such as artistic disciplines. In this paper we explore the effects of an educational video game on high school students' interest towards classical theatre. The game covers the story of ""The Foolish Lady"" (La Dama Boba) based on the homonymous classic theatre play by Spanish playwright Lope de Vega. A mixed experimental design was followed, whereby researchers conducted pre-tests and post-tests to estimate the effect of playing the video game on student interest (within-subjects factor) towards theatre. We also measured changes in linguistic knowledge and knowledge about the play. The experiment was carried out with 754 students from 8 different schools in the Madrid region in Spain, divided into experimental group and two control groups. With the objective of improving the comparative power of the study, two control groups were used: (1) traditional teaching with the usual teacher and, (2) as the best educative case we could implement, teaching with a professional actor who had played the male protagonist of the theatre play. The experimental group played the video game. Results show that the video game was more effective in incrementing students' interest in theatre than the traditional class, but slightly less effective than the class with the actor. On the other hand, game and teacher approaches obtained similar results in the improvement of students' knowledge about the play's plot and some linguistic concepts. These results open up a new horizon in using video games as motivators in different artistic domains. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Digital humanities; Educational games; Media in education; Serious games; Theatre learning","Education computing; Linguistics; Serious games; Students; Theaters; Classroom instruction; Digital humanities; Educational game; Educational video games; High school students; Linguistic knowledge; Media in education; Theatre learning; Human computer interaction","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84936879143"

Materials and Methods: A multidisciplinary team has designed and developed ""InsuOnLine,"" using Andragogy and Problem-Based Learning principles, with game elements to improve players' motivation. The prototype was tested by four medical doctors and two medical students, using the System Usability Scale (SUS) and a questionnaire to assess playability. These results were used to guide corrections, after which the beta version was retested by 14 medical students and 6 residents. Results: Out of a maximum score of 100 on the SUS, the ""InsuOnLine"" prototype was rated 88, and some areas for improvement were identified (game instructions, controls). After corrections, the beta version was rated 92.5 on the SUS. Users have found the beta version to be fun, engaging, challenging, relevant, and realistic. Users said that the game has increased their knowledge on diabetes and insulin, that it has made them feel more confident for prescribing insulin, and that it would have impact on how they treated patients with diabetes. Most users said they have learned more from the game than they would have from a lecture. Lessons learned were the need of early piloting, preferably by users with very little or very much gaming experience, on their own computers and free patterns of use. Conclusions: ""InsuOnLine"" was rated by users as easy to play, fun, and useful for learning. Further studies will assess its educational effectiveness.

Subjects and Methods: Three versions of the game (iPAD, Facebook, and Web-based) were developed using HTML5. A theoretical framework that involved game-based learning and participatory design approach was used to design, develop, modify, and optimize the game for use with secondary school students (n=1176) 12-16 years of age. Pre- and post-test scores of students' safer sex knowledge were compared to test the effectiveness of the game. Students' survey and interviews were analyzed to assess participant feelings and attitudes toward the game. Results: The Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test indicated that students' sex knowledge (n=788) improved with a medium effect size (0.477) after playing the game. Increases in positive attitudes toward sex and relationship and in awareness of making smart sexual choices were reported from student surveys and interviews. Students described the game as ""interesting,"" ""interactive,"" ""informative,"" and ""real-to-life."" Conclusions: We advocate that the participatory design approach, which supports collaborative efforts of different stakeholders, is an effective framework for developing game-based learning tools for sex education. Our work provides preliminary findings that suggest game-based learning, preferably delivered through popular interactive platforms, can be effective in promoting sex education to teenagers. © Copyright 2015, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2015.","","Adolescent; Adolescent Behavior; Child; Female; Health Promotion; Hong Kong; Humans; Internet; Interpersonal Relations; Learning; Male; Program Evaluation; Safe Sex; Sex Education; Sexual Behavior; Software Design; Students; Surveys and Questionnaires; Video Games; adolescent; adolescent behavior; child; evaluation study; female; health promotion; Hong Kong; human; human relation; Internet; learning; male; procedures; program evaluation; psychology; questionnaire; safe sex; sexual behavior; sexual education; software design; student; video game","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84992755792"

A total of 1,258 students across seven postsecondary institutions near Seoul, South Korea, rated their experiences with video game play alongside their online learning activities and preferences toward learning styles that share characteristics with many of today’s games. Utilizing a causal-comparative approach, descriptive and inferential statistical analyses were used to quantitatively examine the groups. At first glance, the findings revealed that the players were more involved in online learning activities than the nonplayers. Namely, the players (a) took more online courses and/or training per year; (b) shared ideas, documents, information, and/or knowledge online, (c) read and/or contributed to blogs; (d) used the Internet to complete school assignments; and (e) used email, instant message, chat (or other means) to communicate with instructors and peers. However, further examination revealed that the nonplayers held a stronger preference than the players for most of the learning styles examined. That is, the nonplayers preferred online courses and/or training that (a) presented graphics before text; (b) provided opportunities to multitask; (c) offered the ability to selectively access different parts of courseware, rather than linearly stepping through; and (d) were play-rather than work-centric. Although exceptions were found, on the whole, these findings suggest that arguments about today’s youth and their different learning preferences, as a result of exposure to and experience with technology, to include video games, may be premature and much more in-depth empirically supported research is needed before definitive conclusions can be safely drawn. © 2016, Canadian Center of Science and Education.

Objective: The purpose of this study is to explore the perceptions of medical educators and medical students regarding the use of social media for educational purposes. Methods: Both groups (medical educators and students) were invited to take a survey. The surveys consisted of 29 questions, including Likert-style, multiple choice, yes/no, ranking, and short answer questions. The survey forms and statistics were built using Google Drive analytics with the free Spanning Stats module. To compare between professors and students, results were exported to a Microsoft Office Excel spreadsheet (Microsoft Corp, Redmond, WA). The study protocol was approved by The Ottawa Health Science Network Research Ethics Board (OHSN-REB:20140680-01H). Results: The overall response rate to the survey was 40.9% (63/154) for students, and 36% (72/200) for medical educators. The majority of educators (79%, 57/72) and students (100.0%, 63/63) had presence on social networking sites (SNSs). Only (33% 19/57) of educators used SNSs with their students, the most used sites were Facebook (52%, 10/19) and Twitter (47%, 9/19), followed by LinkedIn (21%, 4/19), Google+ (16%, 3/19),YouTube (11%, 2/19), and blogs (11%, 2/19). Facebook (100%, 63/63), YouTube (43%, 27/63), Twitter (31%, 20/63), and Instagram (30%, 19/63) were the sites most commonly used by students. The educators used SNSs mainly to post opinions (86%, 49/57), share videos (81%, 46/57), chat (71%, 41/57), engage in medical education (68%, 40/57), take surveys (24%, 14/57), and play games (5%, 3/57). On the other hand, students used SNSs mainly to chat with friends (94%, 59/63), for medical education purposes (67%, 42/63), to share videos (62%, 39/63), to post opinions (49%, 31/63), to take surveys (11%, 7/63), and to play games (6%, 4/63). Most educators (67%, 38/57) do not use social media in their education Although most of the educators (89%, 17/19) and students (73%, 46/63) found the use of social media time-effective, that it offered an inviting atmosphere (89%, 17/19 and 70%, 44/63), and that it enhanced the learning experience (95%, 18/19 and 70%, 44/63), both groups stated that they had colleagues who refused to use social media. The detractors' concerns included privacy issues (47%, 18/38), time-wasting (34%, 13/38), distraction (21%, 8/38), and that these media might not be suitable for education (11%, 4/38). When it came to using SNSs with the students, the educators most often used SNSs to post articles (42%, 8/19), explanatory comments (31%, 6/19), and videos (27%, 5/19).While students preferred the following posts: Quizzes (87% 55/63), revision files (82% 52/63) and explanatory comments (29% 21/63). Conclusions: Although social media continue to grow, some educators find that they do not offer suitable modes of learning. However, it is important to acknowledge that there are persistent differences in technology adoption and use along gender, racial, and socioeconomic lines; this is often referred to as the “digital divide”. The current study shows that students prefer certain posts like quizzes and revision files, while educators are focused on posting videos, articles, and explanatory comments. Medical educators are encouraged to focus on the students in a way to minimize the gap between learners and educators. It will remain our responsibility as educators to focuson the student, use SNSs at their fullest, and integrate them into traditional Web-based management systems and into existingcurricula to best benefit the students. © Safaa El Bialy, Alireza Jalali.

To assess learning performance, words were recalled directly after the break (an 8:30 minute delay) and were recalled and recognized again after 7 days. Based on linear mixed-effects modeling, it was found that playing the Angry Birds video game during a short learning break impaired long-term retrieval in auditory learning but enhanced long-term retrieval in visual learning compared with the music and rest conditions. These differential effects of video games on visual versus auditory learning suggest specific interference of common break activities on learning. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2015.","","Adolescent; Adult; Auditory Perception; Female; Humans; Learning; Male; Memory; Mental Recall; Music; Neuropsychological Tests; Video Games; Visual Perception; Young Adult; adolescent; adult; female; hearing; human; learning; male; memory; music; neuropsychological test; physiology; recall; video game; vision; young adult","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84946819636"

Due to its relative newness as a technology, a dearth of literature exists concerning the requirements for the use of Kinect games in educational settings. A comprehensive review was conducted to include various perspectives in order to provide background information on the existing research base that upholds the educational uses of these games. The review was built on empirical and theoretical studies conducted in the area of multiplayer Kinect games. A total of (748) articles were screened and (71) coded. While an abundance of convergent evidence from closely related domains has been produced on the subject, providing a set of recommendations for its proper usage; few studies have focused specifically on the role, development and effects of multiplayer Kinect games in educational settings. The potential for Kinect games to enhance learning experiences within educational contexts is promising; however, care must be taken to account for physical safety, emotional safety, and activity structure. Specific recommendations for addressing these important aspects of the use of multiplayer Kinect games are described in detail in the body of this manuscript.

Based on Rogers' diffusion of innovation model, this study identified three factors - lifestyles, perceived attributes of GBL, and demographics - as significant predictors for adoption. Two methods were adopted by this study: First, this study conducted 15 intensive interviews to construct questions regarding the perceived attributes of GBL. Second, using a purposive sampling method, this study mailed 347 questionnaires to teachers in Taiwan's elementary schools and obtained 307 valid questionnaires. Two conclusions were drawn from the data analysis: (1) lifestyles and perceived attributes exerted a strong effect, whereas demographics only had a moderate effect in discriminating non-adopters from adopters and likely adopters; (2) the non-adopters in this study were more likely to be males instead of females, to have more teaching experience, to be older, to have no experience with video games, and to be better educated. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Game-based learning; Innovation attributes; Lifestyles; Non-adopters; Rogers' diffusion of innovations","Human computer interaction; Population statistics; Surveys; Diffusion of innovations; Game-based Learning; Innovation attributes; Lifestyles; Non-adopters; Teaching","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84959309309"

Bringing together research on personalizing learning to students' interests and research on student problem-posing offers a potentially important approach to enhancing algebraic understanding. We engaged 24 students in one-on-one interview sessions where they solved and posed algebra story problems based on their out-of-school interests in topics like sports, video games, and social networking. We found that participating in the session enhanced interest in mathematics. However students encountered some difficulties with algebraic problem-posing, including using precise language, accounting for the intercept term, and conceptualizing a relationship between unknown quantities. Using six cases of more successful and less successful students, we uncovered three themes: students' ""funds of knowledge"" about their interest areas acted as an important scaffold, as did prior knowledge of algebra and a grasp of school norms related to story problems. This study reveals how students' out-of-school interests can support the learning of algebra, while also providing a critical examination of the assumptions underlying problem-posing. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Algebra; Funds of knowledge; Interest; Personalization; Problem-posing","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84945286213"

This model brings faculty, students, and community partners together to investigate an open-ended academic question, and their collaboration yields an original product that represents their inquiry. The academic studio integrates agile software development practice, project-oriented pedagogy, and sociocultural cognition theories. Scrum provides the framework in which self-organizing, cross-functional teams define their methodology, and Scrum practices facilitate assessment of student learning outcomes. This model emerged from design-based research across six studio instances, each of which investigated the relationship of fun, games, and learning through the development of educational video games. Formal and informal analysis of these instances gives rise to several themes, including the importance of a formalized process to encourage learning and productivity, the critical role of an expert faculty mentor, the need to combine academic and industrial practice to manage the inherent challenges of collaborative software development, and the unique characteristics of learning outcomes arising from this model. We conclude that the academic studio model is beneficial to student learning and faculty development, and we encourage the adoption, adaptation, and evaluation of the model. © 2016 ACM","And Phrases: Higher education; Computer science education; Design-based research; Interdisciplinary education; Project-based learning; Scrum; Sociocultural cognition theory","Formal methods; Groupware; Software design; Students; Studios; Computer Science Education; Design-based research; Higher education; Interdisciplinary education; Project based learning; Scrum; Sociocultural cognition theory; Education computing","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85051208824"

Dewey and Bentley’s theory of transaction, which views organism-in-environment-as-a-whole, enables the researcher to explore how actions-in-ongoing activities constitute and negotiate PE movement culture. Video footage from seven primary school PE lessons from a school in the West Midlands in the UK was analysed by focusing upon the ends-in-view of actions as they appeared through the educational content (what) and pedagogy (how) of the recorded PE experiences. Findings indicated that the movement culture within the school was a monoculture of looks-like-sport characterised by the privileging of the functional coordination of cooperative action. Three themes of pupils’ and teachers’ negotiation of the movement culture emerged U-turning, Knowing the game and Moving into and out of games. This movement culture required teachers to ensure pupils looked busy and reproduced cooperative looks-like-sport actions. In fulfilling this role, they struggled to negotiate between their knowledge of sport-for-real and directing pupils towards educational ends-in-view within games activities. Simply being good at sports was not a prerequisite for pupils’ success in this movement culture. In order to re-actualise their knowledge of sport, pupils were required to negotiate the teacher's ‘how’ and ‘what’ by exploring what constituted cooperative actions within the spatial and social dimensions of the activities they were set. These findings suggest that if PE is to be more than just the reproduction of codified sport, careful adjustment and consideration of ends-in-view is of great importance. Without regard for the latter there is potential to create significant complexity for both teachers and pupils beyond that required by learning and performing sport. © 2015 The Author(s).

Video games, however, are very successful at sustaining high levels of motivation and engagement through a set of tasks for hours without apparent loss of focus. In addition, gamers solve complex problems within a gaming environment without feeling fatigue or frustration, as they would typically do with a comparable learning task. Based on this notion, the academic community is keen on exploring methods that can deliver deep learner engagement and has shown increased interest in adopting gamification – the integration of gaming elements, mechanics, and frameworks into non-game situations and scenarios – as a means to increase student engagement and improve information retention. Its effectiveness when applied to education has been debatable though, as attempts have generally been restricted to one-dimensional approaches such as transposing a trivial reward system onto existing teaching materials and/or assessments. Nevertheless, a gamified, multi-dimensional, problem-based learning approach can yield improved results even when applied to a very complex and traditionally dry task like the teaching of computer programming, as shown in this paper. The presented quasi-experimental study used a combination of instructor feedback, real time sequence of scored quizzes, and live coding to deliver a fully interactive learning experience. More specifically, the “Kahoot!” Classroom Response System (CRS), the classroom version of the TV game show “Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?”, and Codecademy’s interactive platform formed the basis for a learning model which was applied to an entry-level Python programming course. Students were thus allowed to experience multiple interlocking methods similar to those commonly found in a top quality game experience. To assess gamification’s impact on learning, empirical data from the gamified group were compared to those from a control group who was taught through a traditional learning approach, similar to the one which had been used during previous cohorts. Despite this being a relatively small-scale study, the results and findings for a number of key metrics, including attendance, downloading of course material, and final grades, were encouraging and proved that the gamified approach was motivating and enriching for both students and instructors. © ACPIL.","Assessment; Classroom response system; Game-based learning; Gamification; Higher education; Kahoot; Learning and teaching; Technology enhanced learning; Virtual learning environment","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84968755066"

In response, universities have implemented prevention education initiatives. These interventions, however, often ignore the broader sociocultural context in which sexual violence occurs. This calls for innovative approaches in prevention education, which address the broader context. Computer games provide such an opportunity by providing simulated real-life scenarios, nonlinear narratives, and an interactive medium. We report the development and pilot testing of ""Campus Craft,"" a game prototype that focuses, among other things, on sexual assault prevention. Materials and Methods: The prototype was developed through a participatory design process; students, educators, and subject matter experts helped design and develop scenarios, game mechanics, and learning objectives. The prototype was evaluated by college students (n=141) in a multi-method approach. The evaluation encompassed issues of usability, game mechanics, attitudes, and learning outcomes. Results: Findings indicated that participants rated various aspects of the game positively. Additionally, use of ""Campus Craft"" contributed to differences in student learning of prevention concepts between the pre-and post-test such that students scored higher on the post-test. Conclusions: Findings demonstrate that, on average, students learned several core concepts related to sexual consent and rape culture through gameplay. Results suggest that computer-based gaming may be a viable avenue for sexual assault prevention education. Findings demonstrate that this approach could be effective in increasing student knowledge and understanding of factors that contribute to sexual assault in college. Future research is needed to corroborate findings and better understand the feasibility of using this approach among larger samples of college students. © Copyright 2015, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.","","Adolescent; Adult; Alcohol Drinking; Attitude; Female; Focus Groups; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Male; Narration; Rape; Role Playing; Sex Offenses; Sexual Behavior; Simulation Training; Software Design; Students; Universities; Video Games; Young Adult; adolescent; adult; attitude; drinking behavior; evaluation study; female; human; human relation; information processing; male; prevention and control; psychology; rape; role playing; sexual behavior; sexual crime; simulation training; software design; student; university; verbal communication; video game; young adult","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84992732359"

We examined variables derived from eco-dialogical coding of an episode of World of Warcraft play involving three English learners. According to the Eco-dialogical model (Zheng, 2012), second language (L2) learners need to learn to take skilled linguistic action (Cowley, 2013), a process of realizing the values of physical, sociocultural and dialogical affordances in the environment. We employed Multinomial Logistic Regression to determine which of our variables were predictors for three types of values realizing; namely, wayfinding orienting to sociocultural norms and synergized values realizing of both wayfinding and orientation to sociocultural norms. The model we developed suggested that when communicative projects collectively entailed players' a) verbalizing with synchronized avatar action, b) attending to game rules and c) coordinating in anticipation of good future prospects, players were more likely to realize both values realizing types synergistically. In other words, players' skilled linguistic action of prospective coordination, combined with multimodal languaging and constrained by WoW game rules, together, were more likely to lead to dual values realizing. This finding suggests that dual values realizing evokes connections between real-time first-order physical movements and multimodal languaging with situation transcending practices (Linell, 2009) which are second-order rules, and other sociocultural and linguistic norms. Coupling this finding with our Eco-dialogical unit of analysis, communicative projects, we suggest that these language learners developed co-agency.

The theory of interactive learning is the object of attention of many methodists. The techniques of working with video in the lessons of Russian as a foreign language are of particular interest. Among the forms of interaction between the teacher and the student the interactive form should be recognized as one of the most effective. They are aimed at developing listening and speaking skills and are effective at different stages of training. Game interactive methods help to learn and to hone many speech cliches and scripts used in real communication in an unobtrusive way. Consideration of audiovisual materials in terms of interactivity has not been the subject of serious study of teachers of the Russian language as a foreign language, which determines the relevance and originality of the work. Research methods: descriptive-Analytical, social-pedagogical, modeling of the didactic materials and learning process on the basis of their use. The study found that interactive teaching methods largely intensify the process of mastering a foreign language, engage students in a situation of real communication, applicable to students of different degrees of activity, and contribute to the development of communicative and cultural competence.","Audio-Visual Materials; Communicativeness; Interactivity; Listening; Russian as a foreign language","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85006106922"

Learning within movement culture is practical and embodied, and integral to the cultural and institutional contexts within which PE is situated. Purpose: Using visual data gathered from PE lessons within a UK primary school this paper aims to identify movement cultures across the observed PE lessons, and understand how these movement cultures are shaped and maintained by analysing how teachers and pupils' actions-in-on-going-events make the movement cultures something ‘in-common’. Participants, research design and data collection: A mixture of Year 5 and 6 PE lessons were video recorded within a primary school in the West Midlands. Careful attention was paid to the ethical considerations involved in the collection and storage of the data. Data analysis: By dissolving the dualism between an individual and their environment, Dewey and Bentley's (1949/1991) transactional theory of learning supports an analysis of action in context. Application of this theory enables the researcher to explore actions-in-on-going activities and understand how this action shapes the movement culture within which it occurs. In this process we did not use theory to deduce the participants' intensions or potential changes in their cognitive structures; rather it was the functions' actions constituted in the observed situation, which lead the analysis. Findings: The existence of a multi-activity idea of sampling different sports within this study of primary PE amounted to eating from a smorgasbord where the flavours of the dishes initially looked different, but actually tasted the same. Each dish was differentiated by the use of contrasting equipment, physical locations and named activities. In reality what was realised was a diluted, repetitive and overriding flavour of looks-like-sport. Pupils were tasked with actions which functioned to produce a stage managed show of controlled activity. This was supplemented by their compliance to strict behaviour codes and by attempting to make highly cooperative tasks and games work. This was aided by the adoption and acceptance of different roles. Succeeding within this movement culture demanded an implicit understanding of the need to coordinate actions with others cooperatively. Conclusions: The standout flavour within this smorgasbord involved gymnastics, where the removal of competition and provision of space for pupils to re-actualise their knowledge, created an interesting blend of pupil engagement, sustained physical activity, creativity, inclusion and cooperation. These interesting flavours may have been curtailed by a need to replicate movements acceptable to doing gymnastics-for-real and suggests that other forms of looks-like-sport may have the potential to elicit similar action. Continued investigation of the directions of actions-in-context-in-PE-settings would aid our understanding of the creation, nature and reproduction of learning experiences within this looks-like-sport movement culture. More specifically, analysis of the educational content and pedagogy of the recorded PE lessons within this school would support our understanding of how teachers and pupils negotiate the complex mix of educational, sport and health discourses that constitute the looks-like-sport movement culture. © 2014 Association for Physical Education.","movement culture; primary physical education; transaction","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84955407818"

Method: Six principles of video game design are presented, and their relevance for enriching clinical experiences is discussed. Results: The motivational and learning benefits of each design principle have been discussed in the education literature as having positive impacts on student motivation and learning and are related here to aspects of clinical practice. The essential experience principle suggests connecting all aspects of the experience around a central emotion or cognitive connection. The discovery principle promotes indirect learning in focused environments. The risktaking principle addresses the uncertainties clients face when attempting newly learned skills in novel situations. The generalization principle encourages multiple opportunities for skill transfer. The reward system principle directly relates to the scaffolding of frequent and varied feedback in treatment. Last, the identity principle can assist clients in using their newly learned communication skills to redefine self-perceptions. Conclusion: These principles highlight areas for research and interventions that may be used to reinforce or advance current practice. © 2016 American Speech-Language-Hearing Association.","","Child; Comprehension; Generalization (Psychology); Humans; Language Development Disorders; Male; Motivation; Reward; Semantics; Speech Disorders; Video Games; Vocabulary; child; comprehension; human; Language Development Disorders; learning; linguistics; male; motivation; psychology; reward; semantics; Speech Disorders; video game","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84958757234"

The results indicated that these teachers had a very strong belief that DGP could be beneficial for learning which stemmed from experiencing their own form of subjective success with using DGP in the classroom, availing themselves of information and advocacy about using DGP in the classroom and personal experiences with DGP either through their own DGP or through watching their own children play games. They also shared positive attitudes towards information and communication technologies generally and had initially been invited to use DGP in the classroom by someone in authority. Their use of DGP was also something that they felt made them different to other teachers. Applying these findings to Rogers' Diffusion of Innovations theory predicted that the diffusion rate of using DGP in the classroom will continue to be slow. Finally, this study indicates that teachers need to experience their own form of subjective 'success' in order to find DGP valuable and this subjective 'success' often goes beyond test score performance. © 2015 C.

This research aims to develop an educational video game as a learning support tool that helps undergraduate landscape architecture students to acquire the essential knowledge and skills for the basics of landscape grading. In addition, this research focuses on support-ing the conventional education system by assisting students to gain essential knowledge and skills through achieving the given well-designed learning tasks. In order to enhance motivation and increase learning rate, this educational video game helps students to practice: (1) understanding of the contour map and its rules, (2) identifying the signature landforms and slope shapes, and (3) preparing landscape grading projects to solve storm water drainage problems. This research aims to facilitate the learning of landscape grading topics by visualizing the textual curriculum with three-dimensional models, instructional images and animations. This research also aims to engage students in the learning of landscape grading topics by employing the game mechanics by blending the conventional teaching tools with the opportunities of the gaming technologies. Moreover, the proposed video game presents an immersive self-oriented learning environment that allows students to learn actively by accessing information in a hyperlinked network rather than being listeners of streaming information. The importance of this research lies in the use of existing digital technologies to enhance the learning rate for landscape architecture education as a response of literature deficiency in landscape architecture. In this research, three problem-based learning scenarios were created based on the curriculum and di-vided into instructional and training tasks. The instructional tasks refer to the tutorial tasks, which focus on increasing the understanding and learning of content and encouraging students to engage themselves in the learning process by explaining through the clearly and well-defined instructions. The training tasks allow students to exercise in curricular topics by achieving the given tasks. In addition, the diffi-culty level of training tasks steps up gradually and mentoring support is reduced to help students to increase expertise on given topics. Afterwards, a three-dimensional educational video game was created based on the learning scenarios by re-programming the OpenSimulator software using the LSL scripting language. A three-phased experimental study was conducted in order to overcome the deficiencies identified through evaluations of the prior study; the authors have improved the software. The new improved version was tested on two randomly selected groups (n=32) (control and experiment) of undergraduate landscape architecture students at Istanbul Technical University in order to evaluate the pedagogical and instructional effects of the proposed video game. As a result of the gathered qualitative and quan-titative data, two-tailed paired samples t-test revealed that the experimental group scored 15.42 % higher points (m = 47.1800, s = 9.17499) compared to the control group (m = 31.7667, s = 4.62667), t(2) = 2.030, p≤.05. © Wichmann Verlag, VDE VERLAG GMBH.","Landscape architecture education; Landscape grading; Virtual learning environments","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85102748572"

Creativity is the production of the new, original, unique, and divergent products and ideas mediated through lateral thinking. Evidence suggests that high levels of creativity and fluency are important in the continued development of student interest, efficacy and ultimately career impact in the sciences. Method. In this study, 559 randomly selected students attended an eight-month long workshop on science-based videogame design as a learning tool in the classroom. Students then designed science-based video games exemplifying learned, key, science concepts. Upon completion of the workshop, all students were given the Torrance Test of Creative Thinking to aid in the development of understanding of the relationship between creativity and related constructs. Results. The authors also explore the implications of the role of lateral thinking as a cognitive system mediating science learning. Results suggest a statistically significant difference exists between pretest and posttest outcomes and that the data confirms the suggested model for the role of creative, fluency and lateral thinking related to science processing. Discussion and Conclusion. Seeking to promote interest in creative support tools such as those in use during the design of SEGs can provide disciplinary convergence through lateral thinking.

However, when they confront such problems as graduates, they often do not have time to perform such calculations. Although many commercial software packages exist, most (i) require licence fees and (ii) have a significant learning time. Consequently, commercial packages are generally not a realistic choice for the average plant engineer wanting to solve a quick, ""once off"" problem. SigmaPipe is a new simulation tool that blends video game-like 3D pipe geometry with pressure drop/heat transfer calculations. It was developed as a ""community service"" project specifically to fill the abovementioned gap: it is free, universal and easy to use. It is envisioned that a key factor supporting SigmaPipe's uptake in industry will be creating a bond between the software and the student during undergraduate education.Accordingly, to assess SigmaPipe's potential use in education, evaluation projects were conducted at Curtin University (WA, Australia) and Monash University (Victoria, Australia). The different methodologies and outcomes of the projects are presented here. Student feedback was generally positive and valuable ideas were generated. Importantly, the feedback has already been incorporated into the next version of SigmaPipe. © 2015 The Institution of Chemical Engineers.","Case study; Fluid mechanics; Heat transfer; Process design; Scenario-based learning; Software","Computer software; Education; Fluid mechanics; Heat transfer; Problem solving; Process design; Three dimensional computer graphics; Chemical engineering students; Commercial packages; Commercial software; Community services; Curtin University; Flow and heat transfer; Scenario based learning; Victoria , Australia; Students","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84960891769"

We ask whether specific components of active learning differentially contribute to particular forms of spatial knowledge-the exploration-specific learning hypothesis. Previously, we found that idiothetic information during walking is the primary active contributor to metric survey knowledge (Chrastil & Warren, 2013). In this study, we test the contributions of 3 components to topological graph and route knowledge: visual information, idiothetic information, and cognitive decision making. Four groups of participants learned the locations of 8 objects in a virtual hedge maze by (a) walking or (b) watching a video, crossed with (1) either making decisions about their path or (2) being guided through the maze. Route and graph knowledge were assessed by walking in the maze corridors from a starting object to the remembered location of a test object, with frequent detours. Decision making during exploration significantly contributed to subsequent route finding in the walking condition, whereas idiothetic information did not. Participants took novel routes and the metrically shortest routes on the majority of both direct and barrier trials, indicating that labeled graph knowledge-not merely route knowledge-was acquired. We conclude that, consistent with the exploration-specific learning hypothesis, decision making is the primary component of active learning for the acquisition of topological graph knowledge, whereas idiothetic information is the primary component for metric survey knowledge. © 2014 American Psychological Association.","Decision making; Navigation; Proprioception; Spatial cognition","Exploratory Behavior; Female; Humans; Male; Motion Perception; Psychological Tests; Spatial Learning; User-Computer Interface; Video Games; Video Recording; Young Adult; computer interface; exploratory behavior; female; human; male; movement perception; psychologic test; spatial learning; video game; videorecording; young adult","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84936874713"

Conclusions were that six of the seven team coaches observed at this tournament employed a game centred learning (GCL) design for practicing field-goal shooting (FGS) and these practices reflected a representative learning design (RLD). Video analysis of FGS supported the coaches' interpretations of the coupling of player perception and action processes in this skill. Overwhelmingly, but not totally, in the space of a little more than a decade, FGS practice, as observed by the author, had moved from drilling of skills in closed-skill contexts using command structures, to small-sided GCL practices reflective of a representative learning design.","Field hockey; Game-centred learning; Non-linear pedagogy; Rule changes in sport","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84959476571"

Very little effort has been dedicated to the teaching of proper serious game design and development leading to many examples of serious games that provide little, if any, educational value. Design/methodology/approach - Organized around a collectionof video clips (that provideda brief contextualized overview of the topic and questions for further exploration), readings, interdisciplinary research projects and games, the course introduced the principles of game and instructional design, educational theories used to support game-based learning and methods for evaluating serious games. Discussions and activities supported the problems that students worked on throughout the course to develop a critical stance and approach toward implementing game-based learning. Students designed serious games and examined potential issues and complexities involved in developing serious games and incorporating them within a teaching curriculum. Findings - Results of student course evaluations reveal that the course was fun and engaging. Students found the course fun and engaging, and through the successful completion of the fnal course project, all students met all of the course objectives. A discussion regarding the techniques and approaches used in the course that were successful (or unsuccessful) is provided.

Teaching students to create computer games has become common in both K-12 and tertiary education to introducing programming concepts, increase student engagement and recruit majors and minors in technology fields. This study describes a project where first-year college students in an introductory technology concepts course use a visual game creation tool to develop original games to play on their computers and mobile devices. Design/methodology/approach – The author created a game development exercise which was implemented in three different sections of an introductory technology course. Students who participated were surveyed about their experiences. In addition, the author considers information technology (IT) skills and aspects of authentic learning which are achieved through this assignment. Findings – Initial findings suggest that students found the gaming assignment offers an opportunity for students with no prior programming skills to create software within a controlled and supportive environment. It allows them to demonstrate their understanding of coding principles, including identifying objects and interactions, and that creating software requires a developer to specify exact instructions for the computer to follow. Research limitations/implications – This study is limited to results from one semester and a small number of students participating. In addition, student frustration with the complicated process of publishing games online may have influenced student attitudes toward the assignment. Practical implications – Challenges of implementing this study on a larger scale are discussed. Social implications – Creating games encourages collaborative learning through trial and error, and students who share their games with friends to play on their devices achieve a sense of pride. Originality/value – While most studies of game development emphasize the programming skills that are developed through creating computer games, this paper looks at a larger scope of digital literacy and IT skills achieved, as well as opportunities to perform tasks often completed by IT professionals. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Authentic learning; Electronic media; Game development; Undergraduates; Video games","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84947222231"

There is a limited amount of research supporting their use for medical education, but their are several studies on their use in areas such as surgical training, and life-support re-training. However, a significant gap exists in demonstrating how they engage with learners and games can be used most effectively in medical education. This pilot study assessed the value of digital games for teaching anatomy, by evaluating participant engagement and their attitudes towards a team-based strategy game. Methods: A digital game platform was designed, and then populated with anatomy questions developed by subject matter experts. Second year medical students were recruited to play three matches of the game. At the end of each match participants were asked to complete a Likert rating of their experiences of the game across five domains. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to assess engagement with the platform and perceived value to learners. Results: Sixteen participants volunteered to participate. Post-match ratings indicated that participants had a generally positive experience with the game, with 89 % of respondents agreeing the game was engaging, 93 % of respondents agreeing the game was challenging and 74 % indicating they would like to play the game again if given the opportunity. A total of fourteen participants agreed to be interviewed after playing three matches of the game. Interview responses supported the findings of the post-match ratings that the game was considered enjoyable and engaging. Participants noted they particularly enjoyed the competitive aspect of the game, particularly the opportunity to play against peers they consider their academic equals. In addition to finding the game engaging interview participants indicated they perceived the game impacted on their knowledge around anatomy. In particular, participants noted that the game provided them unique insight into their knowledge strengths and deficits. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that digital games can engage medical students in traditionally-challenging areas such as anatomy and offer learners unique insights into their knowledge strengths and deficits. © 2015 Janssen et al.","","Anatomy; Education, Medical, Undergraduate; Educational Measurement; Female; Histology; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Learning; Male; Pilot Projects; Problem Solving; Sampling Studies; Students, Medical; Video Games; Young Adult; anatomy; comparative study; education; epidemiology; female; histology; human; interview; learning; male; medical education; medical student; pilot study; problem solving; procedures; statistics and numerical data; video game; young adult","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84944060061"

Rather than advocating for bringing MMOs directly into the classroom to deliver content, I focus on designing after-school programs. Starting with a description of the MMO, I define the game space as a digital platform where an array of interest-driven learning takes place. Then, based upon a 2-year, game-based after-school program for teenage boys, the Casual Learning Lab (Steinkuehler & King, 2009).

Drawing on 2010 and 2013 fieldwork investigating a project in Paraguay with 10,000 of OLPC's “XO” laptops, I explore the ways in which participants interpreted leisure laptop use as “learning.” I show that the most captivating uses of the laptops were not “productive” or programming-centric, as OLPC's developers hoped, but “consumptive” and media-centric, focused on music, videos, and video games. I discuss the learning benefits and drawbacks of this use, as understood by participants and in light of education research, and in light of the broader context of transnational corporations interested in marketing to these children. In the process, I weigh OLPC's utopian dreams against the interests of the child beneficiaries, concerns of media imperialism, and a potential shift in the meaning of computers. ©, Published with license by Taylor & Francis.","Children and media; ICTD; ICTE; One Laptop per Child; postcolonial computing; utopianism","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84957837092"

Because children with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) tend to have fewer problems with concentration and engagement when playing digital games, applying game technologies and design approaches to complement treatment may be a useful means to engage this population in their treatment. Unfortunately, gamified training programs currently available for ADHD have been limited in their ability to demonstrate in-game behavior skills that generalize to daily life situations. Therefore, we developed a new serious game (called ""Plan-It Commander"") that was specifically designed to promote behavioral learning and promotes strategy use in domains of daily life functioning such as time management, planning/organizing, and prosocial skills that are known to be problematic for children with ADHD. An interdisciplinary team contributed to the development of the game. The game's content and approach are based on psychological principles from the Self-Regulation Model, Social Cognitive Theory, and Learning Theory. In this article, game development and the scientific background of the behavioral approach are described, as well as results of a survey (n = 42) to gather user feedback on the first prototype of the game. The findings suggest that participants were satisfied with this game and provided the basis for further development and research to the game.

Attentionally demanding, BJB is highly popular among adults, particularly those in middle and later adulthood. In experiment 1, 54 older adults (Mage = 70.57) and 33 younger adults (Mage = 19.82) played 20 rounds of BJB, and completed online tasks measuring reaction time, simple visual search, and conjunction visual search. Prior experience significantly predicted BJB scores for younger adults, but for older adults, both prior experience and simple visual search task scores predicted BJB performance. Experiment 2 tested whether BJB practice alone would result in a carryover benefit to a visual search task in a sample of 58 young adults (Mage = 19.57) who completed 0, 10, or 30 rounds of BJB followed by a BJB-like visual search task with targets present or absent. Reaction times were significantly faster for participants who completed 30 but not 10 rounds of BJB compared with the search task only. This benefit was evident when targets were both present and absent, suggesting that playing BJB improves not only target detection, but also the ability to quit search effectively. Experiment 3 tested whether the attentional benefit in experiment 2 would apply to non-BJB stimuli. The results revealed a similar numerical but not significant trend. Taken together, the findings suggest there are benefits of casual video game playing to attention and relevant everyday skills, and that these games may have potential value as training tools. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2015.","","Adolescent; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Attention; Female; Humans; Male; Practice (Psychology); Reaction Time; Video Games; Young Adult; adolescent; aged; attention; female; human; learning; male; physiology; psychology; reaction time; very elderly; video game; young adult","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84946843204"

The learning is supported by information affordances including a wiki learning management system (LMS) housing the curriculum, organized design activities, social media features, tutorials and informational assignments. Students engage in a Constructionist blended learning setting in their classroom, and work collaboratively in teams on game design. The study draws on qualitative video data from six team cases using a coding scheme of categories for the concepts of task, collaborative information seeking (CIS) Modality, and inquiry resolution outcomes. The study also considers linkages between processes and learning outcomes. Variation in engagement across the categories among students was charted, and certain patterns emerged. Findings indicate that some categories of task appear related to some categories of students' chosen CIS Modality for solving problems. Further, CIS processes in support of tasks appear related to inquiry incident resolution (resolved/unresolved). For student completion of advanced programming tasks in particular, we observe more frequent uses of the wiki-based LMS resources, and greater levels of challenge in fulfilling tasks. Results support existing work on these theoretical constructs in the information sciences, and lead to questions on how naturalistic emergence of CIS practices result from greater task knowledge, and whether learned CIS practices (as tasks in and of themselves) can yield project task knowledge gains. Findings of the study and the ongoing questions the work invites hold instructional design implications, and show how social constructivist educational contexts involving collaborative and information seeking and knowledge building among youth game designers can contribute to scholarly understanding of these processes more broadly in related project-based work contexts occurring among both youth and adults. © 2016 Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals.","Collaborative information-seeking; constructionism; game design; guided discovery-based learning; guided inquiry; information literacy; knowledge-building; learning analytics; sense-making; social constructivism","Architectural design; Computer aided instruction; Curricula; Design; Education; Education computing; Information management; Information science; Information use; Teaching; Collaborative information; Constructionism; Discovery-based learning; Game design; Guided inquiry; Information literacy; Knowledge building; learning analytics; Sense making; Social constructivism; Students","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84954142000"

Adolescence is a period when children progressively look for autonomy and independence. One of the important research questions is whether adolescents utilize screen-based media with or without parental monitoring and limit-setting. This exploratory study examines socio-demographic factors associated with parenting (i.e., co-using, limit setting on the amount, limit setting on contents, and active mediation) in regards to television and video game usage during adolescence. Participants were 799 adolescents (5th to 12th graders) and their parents. Results indicate no gender differences in parental monitoring, but age/grade differences were found with less parental monitoring (more autonomy or independence) of older children. Parental monitoring also differed by ethnicity and by household income. Asian parents were the most restrictive while Hispanic parents were the least restrictive. Parents also reported more active mediation or engagement in families with higher household income. Findings initiate consideration of parenting styles in adolescent media usage, which have implications for adolescent adjustment and developmental outcomes. © 2016 Broadcast Education Association.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84974588025"

One proposed way to help learners build appropriate physics intuitions is to expose them to computer simulations in which motion is based on Newtonian principles. In addition, playing video games that require spatial processing may also facilitate the development of spatial skills that have been associated with learning in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics areas. Two studies were conducted to examine whether playing the first-person perspective puzzle game Portal causes improvements in physics intuitions and spatial cognition skills. In Experiment 1, college students played Portal, the two-dimensional puzzle game Tetris, or the anagram game TextTwist for 75 minutes. There were no significant differences on measures of naïve physics reasoning (selected from the Force Concept Inventory) or measures of spatial cognition (mental rotation and perspective taking). To determine whether Portal could influence formal physics learning, in Experiment 2 participants viewed a brief lesson on Newton's laws of motion after playing one of the three games for 1 hour. The groups did not differ on subsequent tests of physics learning. This study shows that Portal was not successful in priming intuitions about motion or spatial abilities related to physics learning. © 2016 SAGE Publications.","cognitive consequences; perspective taking; physics learning; spatial orientation; video games","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84960880476"

One type of game that has been attracting interest is massively multiplayer online role-playing games (henceforth MMORPGs). Recent research has drawn attention to the potential of these games as arenas for language learning (Peterson, 2013). This paper will analyze the findings of exploratory research focusing on the use of the MMORPG Cube World involving a group of EFL learners based at a university in Japan. Data analysis of text chats, learner feedback and in-class video recordings revealed that the interactive language exchanges between players when they communicate and collaborate with each other in the game appear potentially beneficial for language learners. The data further showed that the participants viewed language learning through Cube World as fun and motivating. This suggests that learner participation in network-based MMORPGs provides an arena for learner centered social interaction that offers valuable opportunities for target language practice.

In this research work, we present the influence of Internet use on academic success of students from five universities in Ecuador. A random sample of 4,697 people was got up and categorized in two groups: the use of Internet in academic activities and entertainment, using factor analysis and cluster analysis; the resulting categories were used as independent variables in multinomial logistic regression model which are seeking to determine if the use of Internet has impacted on academic success. The results show that people who perform interactive activities with peers and teachers or use in a balanced way the different internet tools tend to have more academic success than those who only seeks information. Regarding to the use of Internet in entertainment, a positive impact was found on academic achievement. Students who download audio, video and software, and students who use all the entertainment possibilities show less likely to fail than who using minimally Internet. In terms of gender, it has different effects for entertainment and academic purposes.","Academic achievement; Assessment; Digital divide; Entertainment; Games; Interaction; Online; University","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84987652753"

Design methodology approach – This is a worked example, using a case study and iterative design approach. Each iteration of this course and the reports are from the respective opinions of the instructors. Findings – The authors found that once students looked past games as being pleasant distractions and were able to see them as both context-rich and well-designed learning environments, they were conducive in bringing games to libraries to spur interest-driven learning. Some students tackled analog and digital game design, while others would play historical games and tie those back to available books, and still others used board and video games to bring parents and their children together through play. While these findings do not dictate that this would work in all situations, presenting games and play as an inclusive practice that spans topics and interests was successful. Research limitations andimplications – This research focuses on an LIS course and its development. Research and best practices in this course better inform future designs on how to take games-based design and interest-driven learning into broader areas to use games to spur interest and learning. The authors do not claim that our individual approaches to this class are the best methods in any course using games-based learning. Yet instructors in other fields can take what the authors learned, and the different approaches used to teaching games-based learning, and augment based on the authors’ experiences. Practical implications – This worked example demonstrates that a games-based curriculum can help generate interest in informal learning spaces, such as in libraries. Originality/value – The value of this paper is to emphasize the impact that games and games research can have on other disciplines. Games-based and interest-driven learning are broad enough that their usefulness in other fields is worth consideration. Libraries have been commonly looked at as “old” spaces to acquire knowledge. Combining “old” and “new” technologies to serve a more technologically savvy demographic not only helps the field of games-based learning, but also helps those in LIS how to better service a new generation of learners in collaborative relationships. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Games; Libraries; Library and information science","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84958544411"

Using survey methodology, students anonymously assessed their perceptions of in-class activities, out-of-class activities, and instructional materials as most impactful, helpful, and enjoyable to their learning. Undergraduate college students found Jeopardy games, PowerPoint slides, and checking for understanding/review questions to be most helpful, while 50% often perceived Jeopardy games, Poll Everywhere, videos, and PowerPoint slides as enjoyable active learning strategies. Graduate students perceived small groups, out-of-class writing assignments, and Lino as most helpful to their learning. Additionally, an analysis of student comments about why these strategies were impactful, helpful, and enjoyable revealed 4 themes: fun, learning collaboratively, challenging but helpful, and variety in how students learn. Creating a learner-centered environment that is engaging as well as enjoyable for students positively impacts perceptions of students’ learning, which should encourage teachers to adopt this approach in their own college classrooms.

Cognitive retraining of automatic appetitive processes related to alcohol (so-called cognitive bias modification [CBM]) may help to prevent escalation of use. Although effective as a treatment in clinical patients, the use of CBM in youth proves more difficult, as motivation in this group is typically low, and the paradigms used are often viewed as boring and tedious. This article presents two separate studies that focused on three approaches that may enhance user experience and motivation to train: a serious game, a serious game in a social networking context, and a mobile application. Materials and Methods: In the Game Study, 77 participants performed a regular CBM training, aimed at response matching, a gamified version, or a placebo version of that training. The gamified version was presented as a stand-alone game or in the context of a social network. In the Mobile Study, 64 participants completed a different CBM training, aimed at approach bias, either on a computer or on their mobile device. Results: Although no training effects were found in the Game Study, adding (social) game elements did increase aspects of the user experience and motivation to train. The mobile training appeared to increase motivation to train in terms how often participants trained, but this effect disappeared after controlling for baseline motivation to train. Conclusions: Adding (social) game elements can increase motivation to train, and mobile training did not underperform compared with the regular training in this sample, which warrants more research into motivational elements for CBM training in younger audiences. © Copyright 2015, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.","","Adult; Alcohol Drinking; Alcoholism; Association Learning; Behavior, Addictive; Binge Drinking; Cognition; Female; Humans; Male; Mobile Applications; Motivation; Pleasure; Students; Surveys and Questionnaires; Video Games; Young Adult; addiction; adult; alcoholism; binge drinking; cognition; drinking behavior; female; human; learning; male; mobile application; motivation; pleasure; prevention and control; psychology; questionnaire; rehabilitation; student; video game; young adult","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84993212457"

Despite significant effort by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign and other initiatives, sepsis remains underrecognized and undertreated. APPROACH: Research indicates that educating providers may improve sepsis diagnosis and treatment; thus, the Stanford School of Medicine has developed a mobile-accessible, case-based, online game entitled Septris (http://med.stanford.edu/septris/). Septris, launched online worldwide in December 2011, takes an innovative approach to teaching early sepsis identification and evidence-based management. The free gaming platform leverages the massive expansion over the past decade of smartphones and the popularity of noneducational gaming.The authors sought to assess the game's dissemination and its impact on learners' sepsis-related knowledge, skills, and attitudes. In 2012, the authors trained Stanford pregraduate (clerkship) and postgraduate (resident) medical learners (n = 156) in sepsis diagnosis and evidence-based practices via 20 minutes of self-directed game play with Septris. The authors administered pre- and posttests. OUTCOMES: By October 2014, Septris garnered over 61,000 visits worldwide. After playing Septris, both pre- and postgraduate groups improved their knowledge on written testing in recognizing and managing sepsis (P < .001). Retrospective self-reporting on their ability to identify and manage sepsis also improved (P < .001). Over 85% of learners reported that they would or would maybe recommend Septris. NEXT STEPS: Future evaluation of Septris should assess its effectiveness among different providers, resource settings, and cultures; generate information about how different learners make clinical decisions; and evaluate the correlation of game scores with sepsis knowledge.","","Attitude of Health Personnel; Clinical Competence; Consumer Behavior; Decision Support Techniques; Humans; Mobile Applications; Online Systems; Problem-Based Learning; Sepsis; Video Games; clinical competence; consumer attitude; decision support system; health personnel attitude; human; mobile application; online system; problem based learning; sepsis; video game","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84922397472"

Furthermore, when we look at VR system deployment from a human-computer interaction (HCI) lens, does user's attitude play a role in achieving the final outcome? This study aims to understand the effect of immersion and involvement, as well as users' regulatory focus on usability for a somatosensory VR learning system.

The game provides a sandbox-style environment that allows students to interact with their digital surroundings in an extremely flexible way. MinecraftEdu was used alongside more traditional teaching methods at both schools to engage students in Earth Science and subsequent topics. Surveying students before and after the program took place and collecting anecdotal evidence during class through teacher observations assessed the value of the software. The comparison of the student surveys indicated a clear increase in student interest in science and the use of ICTs in school following the MinecraftEdu program. A majority of students, 84%, reported enjoying using MinecraftEdu in the classroom and 94% said they wanted to use MinecraftEdu in the classroom again.

Thirty-six subjects from non-technical backgrounds played the action-oriented, first person perspective, commercial video game Half Life 2. Our team “modded” the game to use an original world map, and added a mechanic in which buttons and other objects in the game world could be shot with the player’s weapon and, in so doing, activate switches and puzzles. The game required players to solve a series of puzzles based on Boolean logic, presented in the nomenclature of programming languages. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of two groups: high-challenge and low-challenge. To advance within the game, players were required to fight through waves of enemies, and then solve a Boolean logic puzzle at choke points within the game map. Subjects in the high-challenge group were required to manually work through the puzzles through trial and error, while subjects in the low-challenge group were presented the puzzle in its solved state. The independent variable was therefore the degree of challenge required to resolve a choke point and advance. To assess concept acquisition, both groups were administered pre- and post-game multiple-choice quizzes that contained several Boolean logic problems. Pre- and post-game quiz scores were compared to determine if a) there was any improvement between pre and post, and b) challenge level was a factor in predicting performance. Analysis by two-way ANOVA revealed no significant performance difference in quiz scores for either the high- or low-challenge group. Our findings should be regarded as incremental rather than conclusive, as it is unclear whether a floor effect was observed -- an indication the test material was too difficult for both levels-- or if, in fact, there was no difference between the two groups. The authors recommend further study in a less technically challenging problem domain wherein test scores demonstrate more variance. © 2015 American Society for Engineering Education.

However, many students from ""underserved backgrounds"" lack the exposure to rigorous pre college quantitative and qualitative programs. These same ""underserved"" students are afforded significantly less resources in relation to their peers, thus they tend to be exposed to a higher risk of lower academic achievement. Without a grasp of these foundational tools, a student's performance in collegiate-level courses may be severely handicapped. This paper serves to analyze the pertinence of reading and critical thinking skill-sets along with math course intervention tools in enhancing the performance of students who are largely from ""underserved communities"" in Principles of Economics courses. The authors examine the relationship of student's pre and post math, reading motivation and critical thinking skills on the students' overall performance in Principles of Economics courses at a Historically Black College and University. Among the preliminary findings, the math pre-test results were significantly poor thus the authors knew it was compelling that most students work on math intervention skills within the study period. The students consequently used Smart Thinking online tutorial service, which is a virtual tutoring service, to help improve their math skills concurrently with their principles of economics courses. Other interventions strategies included redesigning the course to include more student participation individually and in-groups. This entailed replacing one class meeting a week with activities such as relevant videos and games, in-class small group problem solving, and debates as well as individual online assignments. An Undergraduate Learning Assistant was also placed in an experimental redesign course to serve as additional assistance for the students. For this paper, an empirical regression based on data from three sections of the principles of macroeconomics course was used to test the effects of reading motivation, math and critical thinking skills on student performance in the course. The dependent variable for the regression involved a difference in the pre and post scores on a comprehensive economics test. The utilization of pre and post economics test scores were taken into account for fixed effect changes in student characteristics. The findings reveal that while math plays a significant role in increasing Principles of Economics students' scores, students' motivation to read is a greater predictor of performance in the principles courses. The study also finds significant gain in knowledge of the principles of economics for students who combine good math skills and a strong motivation to read. The redesign hybrid variable showed a strong statistical relationship with the performance of students in the course compared to the redesign face-to-face class. This can possibly be explained by the consideration that students in the hybrid class spent time in the non-face to face periods to seek more tutoring. Other variables such as student's gender, year of study, transfer versus non-transfer students, and full time versus part time were found to be insignificant. It is indicative from the study that interventions to build students' skills in math and reading as well as critical thinking would benefit principles of economics students in general and those from ""underserved backgrounds"" in particular. The implications of the findings of this study, stress the importance of developing math and reading intervention tools within the economics principles courses.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84959339884"

Despite considerable progress in HIV stigma-reduction research, we are still searching for effective strategies that can be implemented on a larger scale. To narrow this research gap, the present study investigated a novel cost-effective approach to reducing HIV-related stigma among health professionals. Interactive experiential games were used to help participants gain first-hand experience of potential stressors that PLHIV might encounter. The effectiveness of this game-based experiential approach was compared with that of in vivo contact in reducing HIV-related stigma among students in the health-care fields. Eighty-eight students of health-related programs in Hong Kong were randomly assigned to either the game-based or in vivo contact program. They completed measures of stigmatizing attitudes and HIV/AIDS-related knowledge at pre-program, post-program, and one-month follow-up. Findings showed that the effectiveness of the game-based experiential approach in reducing HIV-related stigma was similar to that of in vivo contact both at post-program and one-month follow-up.

Our goal in this manuscript is to ask how and why these new technologies create opportunities for learning. We suggest that AR is uniquely positioned to support learning through its ability to support students in developing “conceptual blends”—which we propose extend beyond cognitive spaces to include the layering of multiple ideas and physical materials, often supplied by different conversation participants. We document one case study and trace how the narrative structure of a board game, the physical floor materials (e.g. linoleum), a student’s first-person embodied experiences, the third-person live camera feed, and the augmented-reality symbols become integrated in the activity. As a result, students’ conceptualization of force and friction become fused with a diverse set of intellectual resources. We conclude by suggesting that the framework of liminal blends may inform the design of future AR learning environments and in particular help generate predictions about the ways in which the juxtaposition of certain resources may otherwise produce unexpected results. © 2015, International Society of the Learning Sciences, Inc.","Augmented Reality; Conceptual blends; Elementary education; Physics education; Play; Video analysis","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84925487791"

Seventeen seventh-grade students (seven girls, 10 boys, average age 11.8) participated in a 25-lesson volleyball season, in which the structural features followed those of sport education and the specific content followed the didactical framework of the SGA. Data were collected prior to the first lesson (pre-test), following the completion of the unit (post-test) and seven days after the post-test (retention). The game performance assessment instrument was used in a systematic observation of video records of students’ behaviours while playing a 10-minute 2vs2 game. A 2 (sex) × 3 (time) and a 2 (skill-level) × 3 (time) analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures across the three tests was used to compare the students’ performances on all indexes. Results showed that both boys and girls made improvements from the pre-test to the post-test and maintained those improvements to the retention test in almost all the indexes analysed. Further, the results also showed that lower skill-level students realized greater gains than those of higher skill during the unit, which reinforces the idea that future implementations of this hybrid approach should adjust content and learning task to different skill-levels. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","GPAI; learning outcomes; physical education; sex; skill-level","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84964802563"

This paper describes a genre of learning environments called constructionist video games that are especially well suited for developing learners' computational thinking skills. These games blend features of conventional video games with learning and design theory from the constructionist tradition, making the construction of in-game artifacts the core activity of gameplay. Along with defining the constructionist video game, the authors present three design principles central to thier conception of the genre: the construction of personally meaningful computational artifacts, the centrality of powerful ideas, and the opportunity for learner-directed exploration. Using studies conducted with two constructionist video games, the authors show how players used in-game construction tools to design complex artifacts as part of game play, and highlight the computational thinking strategies they engaged in to overcome game challenges.

The study assumed that goal-directed player activity in this environment would configure digital narratives, which in turn would help study participants in the experimental group to co-configure story maps for ordering and making sense of the problem spaces encountered in the environment. The study further assumed that these participants would subsequently rely on the story maps to help them structure written L2 narratives describing an imagined personal experience closely resembling the gameplay of the 3D-DGBLL environment. The study found that immersion in the 3D-DGBLL environment influenced the manner in which the second language was invoked in these written narratives: Participants in the experimental group produced narratives containing more textual indicators describing the activity associated with the recycling and waste management systems and the spaces in which these systems are located. Increased usage of these indicators suggest that participants in the experimental group did indeed rely on story maps generated during 3D gameplay to structure their narratives, although stylistic and grammatical features of the narratives suggest, however, that changes could be made to the curricular implementation of the 3D-DGBLL environment. The study also puts forward ideas for instructional best practices based on research findings and suggests future areas of development and investigation.

Materials and Methods: Participants attended four weekly gameplay sessions. Surveys were conducted at baseline and following each week's gameplay and assessed satisfaction with gameplay, craving intensity, and self-efficacy to refuse opioids. Results: Participants expressed a high level of satisfaction with the videogame throughout the 4 weeks and agreed with the statement that they would be more likely to attend treatment sessions if the game was present (mean=4.6; standard deviation [SD]=0.7) and would recommend the videogame to other people in treatment (mean=4.2; SD=0.8). All participants recommended playing the videogame as part of treatment at least weekly, with a third recommending playing daily. Self-reported cravings declined over the 4-week period from baseline (mean=12.7; SD=8.4) to Week 4 (mean=9.8; SD=8.3), although the decline was not significant. Although participants stated that they liked the game, one-third of participants had dropped out of the study by the fourth session of gameplay. Conclusions: Preliminary evidence indicates that a motion videogame for addiction recovery may be feasible and acceptable within the context of outpatient treatment, although additional efforts are needed to keep youth in treatment. Future studies are needed to assess the impact of the game on long-term abstinence, treatment adherence, and engagement. © Copyright 2015, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.","","Adolescent; Ambulatory Care; Analgesics, Opioid; Avoidance Learning; Craving; Female; Humans; Male; Personal Satisfaction; Secondary Prevention; Self Efficacy; Self Report; Self-Control; Substance-Related Disorders; Video Games; Young Adult; narcotic analgesic agent; adolescent; ambulatory care; avoidance behavior; craving; female; human; male; procedures; psychology; satisfaction; secondary prevention; self concept; self control; self report; Substance-Related Disorders; video game; young adult","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84993958649"

The sector of the population looking for instruction on these subjects has increased and diversified. We need new tools that appeal to this wider audience, and game-based learning is one of the most promising approaches at the moment. There is a need for more scalable game-based instruction paradigms that can be easily adapted to different levels of complexity and content related to CS (different programming languages, different programming paradigms, and so on). Throughout this paper, we present a flexible and scalable architecture to create videogames for learning CS languages. The architecture is based on the idea that students control the game using small pieces of text written in some CS language. The keys of the scalability of our approach are: 1) it separates the CS language used to write the programs from the game design and 2) the game model provides a system of levels that allows incremental learning of CS language structures. As validation and implementation of our approach, we developed Lost in Space, an educational videogame to teach the XML markup language. In this game, the player travels through several levels, guiding a spaceship by introducing small pieces of XML in a text console. Players can move and rotate the ship among other power-ups that get unblocked as they advances in the game. The game was tested with undergraduate students from CS and social sciences, by comparing it with traditional instruction (i.e., a teacher with a slides presentation). Students who played the game were much more engaged than those who attended the lecture, showing a more active attitude throughout the whole experience and also spent more time practicing after class. Findings also suggest that the game was effective for instruction, regardless of the background of the students. However, the educational gain observed with the game-based instructional approach, although effective, was not significantly higher than traditional instruction. We think that our approach is adequate to introduce CS languages in general, as well as new programming languages, and seems to be more appealing to new comers than traditional instruction. © 2013 IEEE.","Application software; computer programming; educational technology; Educational videogames; software architecture","Application programs; Computational linguistics; Computer programming; Education; Education computing; Educational technology; Hypertext systems; Software architecture; Students; Teaching; XML; Game-based Learning; Incremental learning; Language structure; Programming paradigms; Scalable architectures; Traditional instruction; Undergraduate students; Video game; Computer games","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84947572903"

However, the detection of the user's affection such as motivation and emotion is challenging especially when an attention problem is present. An approach to convey learning resources to children with learning problems is by means of game-based tools. The first step towards building these ludic experiences is to identify the skills and limitations of potential users. In this work we describe a case based study carried out to observe and get understanding of the level of attention, cognition and memory of children with ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder). Fifteen children were invited to play physical and digital versions of the Stroop and Flanker tests as well as memory-based games. The interaction with KAPEAN is allowed with both a mouse and a hand gestures recognition device. To collect data from the user's experiences the system integrates a webcam, a Microsoft Kinect device, a video camera, and an Emotiv EEG headset. Data was analyzed offline in order to study which affective states are present while children with ADHD played with KAPEAN.","Affective states; Attention deficit disorder; Learning difficulties; Ludic experiences","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84964543883"

This article examines the role that language plays in a scientific literacy test for which everyday life is an augmented aspect. Video-recorded data was collected in four ninth-grade science classes in a Swedish compulsory school as small groups of students discussed and collaboratively solved Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) science test items. The theoretical framework assumes sociocultural perspectives as well as that of Wittgenstein's later works on language. The study involves an analysis of students' meaning making of specific words that occur in the test and the various language games to which these words contribute. Specifically, we analyzed the students' use of four different words: reference, constant, pattern, and factor. We found that the students use these words in everyday or mathematical language games; for example, understanding the word ""pattern"" as a mathematical regularity rather than a result of a scientific experiment. The results were analyzed in relation to the specific illustrations and wording that contextualize the items. We argue that a crucial part of being scientifically literate is privileging science content over other possible disciplines and contexts and ignoring the everyday perspective. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84958679071"

While many preconceptions exist about the audience of these sources, often perpetuated by stereotypes around “gamer” culture, recent surveys have shown their wide-ranging demographic. Additionally, the masculine gender bias that is perceived to exist within gaming communities has been shown to be rapidly decreasing. This emerging universality has inevitably encouraged educationalists to consider how best to utilise gaming and elements of video game technology in the development of e-learning tools. Alongside their audio-visual features, it is the experiential and phenomenological characteristics of video games that can be employed to allow students to conceptualise abstract principles and actively experiment with their own ethical beliefs in an environment free of real-world consequences. Building upon the work of Maharg and Owen, and Lettieri et al., this paper will explore the potential of video games as a tool for experiential learning, specifically the study of ethics and related jurisprudential themes, and will propose how existing video games can be used as an educational tool for phenomenological experimentation of concepts. Finally, this article will draw upon the author’s previouswork to assert how video games can be used as a learning tool for the conceptualisation of abstract themes, specifically justice. © 2016 The Association of Law Teachers.","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84964291999"

As digitally-based games become increasingly prevalent in both formal and informal learning environments, robust research and assessment vehicles within well-designed games become vital. A central challenge with this video games research in education is to demonstrate evidence of player learning. Rather than ignore the motivating and information-rich features of games in capturing learning, assessment designers need to attend to the ways in which game-play itself can provide a powerful new form of assessment. This requires learning researchers to think of games as both intervention and assessment; and to develop methods for using the internal structures of games as paths for evidence generation to document learning. ADAGE consists of two main layers: 1) the semantic template that determines which click-stream data events could be indicators of learning; 2) the learning telemetry that captures data for analysis. This study highlights how ADAGE was implemented in science game to provide a wealth of in-game player data indicative of both gameplay and learning progress to reveal important relationships between kinds of success, failure and learning in the game. © Copyright 2014 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","ADAGE; Digital media and learning; Educational data mining; Educational games; Embedded assessment; Evidence centred design; Game-based assessment; Game-based learning; Learning analytics; Technology-based assessment","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84928478783"

The primary aim of developing a game-based platform for student-research collaboration is to investigate if and how this type of game concept can strengthen authentic experimental practice and the creation of new knowledge in science education. Researchers and game developers tested the game in three separate high school classes (Class 1, 2, and 3). The tests were documented using video observations of students playing the game, qualitative interviews, and qualitative and quantitative questionnaires. The focus of the tests has been to study players' motivation and their experience of learning through participation in authentic scientific inquiry. In questionnaires conducted in the two first test classes students found that the aspects of doing ""real scientific research"" and solving physics problems were the more interesting aspects of playing the game. However, designing a game that facilitates professional research collaboration while simultaneously introducing quantum physics to high school students proved to be a challenge. A collaborative learning design was implemented in Class 3, where students were given expert roles such as experimental and theoretical physicists. This significantly improved the students' feeling of learning physics compared to Class 1 and 2. Overall the results presented in this paper indicate that the possibility of participating in authentic scientific experiments, which this class of games opens, is highly motivating for students. The findings also show that the learning design in the class setting must be considered in order to improve the students' experience of learning and that various design challenges remain to be addressed even further. © ACPIL.","Game-based learning; Learning games; Science education; Scientific discovery games","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84904037038"

In the health game used to apply this model, students interact with characters in the game through phone messages, mail messages, SMS and video. Perceived authenticity is measured after the game in 196 phone interviews that yield quantitative and qualitative results. We show evidence of relationships between attributes of the game environment and perceived authenticity. This yields a list of parameters that can be adjusted to favour authenticity. We also study three situations of interaction and show when and why they are perceived as authentic, or not.

Playful learning with IPS allows internalization of medical workflows without harming real patients. Ideally, IPS show high student acceptance and can have positive effect on knowledge gain. Development of IPS with high technical quality is resource intensive. Therefore most of the ""high-fidelity"" IPS are commercially driven. Usage of IPS in the daily curriculum is still rare. There is no academic-driven simulator that is freely accessible to every student and combines high immersion grade with a profound amount of medical content. Aim Therefore it was our aim to develop an academic-driven IPS prototype that is free to use and combines a high immersion grade with profound medical content. In addition, a first validation of the prototype was conducted. Methods The conceptual design included definition of the following parameters: amount of curricular content, grade of technical quality, availability, and level of validation. A preliminary validation was done with 25 students. Students opinion about acceptance was evaluated by a Likert-scale questionnaire. Effect on knowledge gain was determined by testing concordance and predictive validity. Results A custom-made simulator prototype (Artificial learning interface for clinical education [ALICE]) displays a virtual clinic environment that can be explored from a first-person view similar to a video game. By controlling an avatar, the user navigates through the environment, is able to treat virtual patients, and faces the consequence of different decisions. ALICE showed high students acceptance. There was positive correlation for concordance validity and predictive validity. Simulator usage had positive effect on reproduction of trained content and declarative knowledge. Conclusions We successfully developed a university-based, IPS prototype (ALICE) with profound medical content. ALICE is a nonprofit simulator, easy to use, and showed high students acceptance; thus it potentially provides an additional tool for supporting student teaching in the daily clinical curriculum. © 2015 Association of Program Directors in Surgery.","immersion; immersive patient simulators; Key Words ALICE; procedural knowledge; validity; web-based learning","Adult; Clinical Competence; Clinical Decision-Making; Female; General Surgery; Humans; Internet; Male; Simulation Training; User-Computer Interface; Young Adult; adult; Article; clinical decision making; clinical education; computer; cost effectiveness analysis; equipment design; female; human; immersive patient simulator; instrument validation; knowledge; learning; male; medical student; motivation; multiple choice test; predictive validity; priority journal; simulator; student attitude; surgical training; video game; virtual reality; clinical competence; computer interface; education; general surgery; Internet; organization and management; procedures; simulation training; validation study; young adult","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84931097633"

Engagement has been identified as a crucial component of learning in games research. However, the conceptualization and operationalization of engagement vary widely in the literature. Many valuable approaches illuminate ways in which presence, flow, arousal, participation, and other concepts constitute or contribute to engagement. However, few studies examine multiple conceptualizations of engagement in the same project.; Method. This article discusses the results of two experiments that measure engagement in five different ways: survey self-report, content analyses of player videos, electro-dermal activity, mouse movements, and game click logs. We examine the relationships among these measures and assess how they are affected by the technical characteristics of a 30-minute, custom-built, educational game: use of a customized character, level of narrative complexity, and level of art complexity.; Results. We found that the five measures of engagement correlated in limited ways, and that they revealed substantially different relationships with game characteristics. We conclude that engagement as a construct is more complex than is captured in any of these measures individually and that using multiple methods to assess engagement can illuminate aspects of engagement not detectable by a single method of measurement. © 2014 SAGE Publications.","art; art complexity; attention; character customization; content analyses; customized character; EDA; educational games; electro-dermal activity; engagement; game clicks; interactivity; measurement; mouse movements; multiple methods; narrative; narrative complexity; presence; self-report; transportation","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84921455575"

Though there is an emerging presence of Chinese online games, many more young people are playing the English- or Japanese-language versions of the most popular commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) video games. In other words, most Chinese gamers are playing L2 digital games in their leisure time. Informed by research on out-of-class L2 learning, this paper discusses findings from an exploratory study investigating L2 gaming and learning practices in young people's everyday lives. Drawing on rich data from gaming sessions, stimulated recall, focus group discussion, individual interviews and online discussion forums, this paper argues that gamers exercise autonomy by managing their gameplay both as leisure and learning practices in different dimensions (location, formality, locus of control, pedagogy and trajectory). At the same time, gameplay-as-learning practices are supported by wider communities of digital gamers who take on roles as language teachers and advisers. The paper suggests that activities in these dimensions mediated learning autonomously and from community, and discusses the research and pedagogical implications for L2 gaming and learning. © Alice Chik.","Computer-assisted language learning; Learner autonomy; Second language acquisition","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84901217961"

We iteratively tested and refined the design with over 130 students as well as their teachers, parents, and content experts. In the end, we created a new instructional model called mini anchors, a prescription for how to individualize instruction by embedding numerous, short, video-based scenarios within a computer-based program to provide learners with multiple ways to perceive, engage with, and interact with the content.

This study uses well-established, basic learning theory to clarify the concept of escapism, and examines its relation to problematic gaming, psychological distress, and satisfaction with life among players of massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs). MMORPG players (n=201) answered an online questionnaire where these factors were measured and correlated with a previously developed scale on motivation to play (MTPI), including extra items to cover positive and negative aspects of escapism. Factor analysis and construct validation show that positive aspects of escapism are theoretically and empirically unstable and that escapism is best clarified as purely ""negative escapism,"" corresponding to playing being negatively reinforced as a way of avoiding everyday hassles and distress. Negative escapism had a stronger relationship to symptoms of Internet addiction, psychological distress, and life satisfaction than other variables and other more positive motivations to play. Future studies should use the revised subscale for escapism (in the MTPI-R) presented in the present study, for example when screening for Internet addiction. © 2014 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.","","Adolescent; Adult; Behavior, Addictive; Child; Female; Humans; Internet; Male; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Motivation; Personal Satisfaction; Personality Disorders; Psychometrics; Questionnaires; Stress, Psychological; Video Games; Young Adult; addiction; adolescent; adult; article; child; female; human; Internet; male; mental health; mental stress; middle aged; motivation; personality disorder; psychological aspect; psychometry; questionnaire; recreation; satisfaction; young adult","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84892741545"

More specifically, it compares the results from students using Kahoot! for the first time in a single motivational lecture vs. using Kahoot! in every lecture in a class for five months. The quasi-experiment focused on how the students' perception changed in relation to user-friendliness, engagement, motivation, classroom dynamics, concentration, and perceived learning. The results show a slight reduction in the students motivation and engagement, but the only statistically significant wear out effect found was related to classroom dynamics. At large, the game-based student response system managed to boost students engagement, motivation and learning after using it repeatedly for five months.

Specifically, this study adopts exploratory research as a means to examine the perceptions of preservice teachers before and after using a set of video games as teaching and learning tools. A convenience sampling method was used with 41 preservice teachers. Data collected came from a researcher-developed survey instrument that queried participants’ perceptions of the value of videogames as learning tools. Findings indicated that although a majority agreed that video games can support many specific teaching and learning tasks, many remain skeptical of their value in classroom settings, with many of those participants also doubting their ability to successfully integrate video games into their teaching. In terms of willingness to use video games in their teaching, a small positive change occurred within the group reporting neutrality on the pretest. Given these results, a discussion of issues related to willingness to integrate video games is offered. © 2015, © 2015 ISTE.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85017746217"

Our view is that organizational creativity orchestrates continuous interactions between different types of routines, operating at different levels of the organization. More precisely we propose distinguishing three types of routines: - First, the routines issued from formal structures or hierarchical working groups in the firm (functional groups, project teams, task force, etc.), for which the context of work and coordination of specialized tasks is defined ex ante by the hierarchy of the firm; - Second, the routines emerging from informal structures, the ""knowing communities"" which is a ""generic term that defines different types of autonomous learning groups of individuals (communities of practice, epistemic communities, and other more or less informal learning groups) united by common beliefs and interests who voluntarily share their resources on a long term basis in order to create and diffuse knowledge""; - Third, the routines that are inherently related to the organizational creativity of the firm, which are essentially corporate routines as expression of patterns of thinking, feeling and acting in the corporate culture. In essence they are the genes of collective identity, and take the shape of project management staging and gating principles and practices, framing collective divergent exploration and convergent production toward a creative goal. The contribution is based on an in-depth analysis of the organizational creativity in the world-leading videogame company, Ubisoft, with a special focus on the studio located in Montréal. To some extent, Ubisoft is one of the flagships of the ""creative industries"", in which the clear imperative is to sustain creativity on a permanent basis. These reasons explain the choice we made to test our approach of organizational creativity and routines in this firm. © 2014, Walter de Gruyter GmbH.

The school in this case study research is one of the first primary-level future schools that was set up under the FutureSchools@Singapore program in 2008. The school has implemented a successful one-to-one program (i.e. one-to-one computer to student ratio) for all its students. The use of blogs, communication applications (e.g. online chats and email), online educational games, online learning management systems, online searches for information and educational related videos were commonly used to integrate ICT into the teaching and learning of the various subjects mentioned above. A total of 221 (Primary 3 and 4) and 466 (Primary 3, 4 and 5) students participated in an ICT usage survey conducted in 2011 and 2012, respectively. Three interesting phenomena were observed through the descriptive statistics. First, it was observed that the ICT usage rates for the various subjects (i.e. English, mathematics and science) peaked at the primary 4 level when the computer ownership program was introduced and declined in primary 5. Second, descriptive statistical analysis suggested the use of blogs, communication applications, online educational games and Internet searches, were more frequently used, as compared to the learning management systems and the use of videos, in the students' learning of English, mathematics and science. Thirdly, ICT usage rates were also different for the different classes of Primary 5. Follow-up interviews with teachers and student open-ended survey responses were also analysed.

The article is based on an in-depth ethnographic study of the launch of a progressive New York City public middle school. The school aimed to integrate twenty-first-century digital technologies and skills into the curriculum while promoting student-centered learning and social equity. The article argues that educators and privileged parents constructed an educational context that facilitated and legitimized students who enacted masculinities rooted in video game culture even as it disciplined and purged students who enacted masculinities rooted in more canonical forms of boy culture. In doing so, the school paradoxically helped perpetuate the racialized class divisions that it hoped new media would help it overcome. © 2014 by The University of Chicago.

The present study was designed to investigate whether the scores on the WOMBAT™ Situational Awareness and Stress Tolerance Test (Roscoe and North 1980) would predict the transfer of DDM performance from training under different levels of cognitive load to a novel situation. Participants practised a simulated firefighting task under either low or high conditions of cognitive load and then performed a (transfer) test in an alternative firefighting environment under an intermediate level of cognitive load. WOMBAT™ test scores were a better predictor of DDM performance than scores on the Raven Matrices. Participants with high WOMBAT™ scores performed better regardless of their training condition. Participants with recent gaming experience who practised under low cognitive load showed better practice phase performance but worse transfer performance than those who practised under high cognitive load. Practitioner Summary: The relationship between task experience, situational awareness ability, cognitive load and the transfer of dynamic decision-making (DDM) performance was investigated.

The evaluation of the video game presented here aims at showing that video games have representational advantages that facilitate the construction of dynamic mental models. Ultimately, the article shows that when video game's characteristics come in contact with expert knowledge during game design, the game becomes an excellent medium for supporting the learning of disciplinary content related to dynamic processes.

Consistent with the study hypotheses, observations revealed that most students were highly engaged, but engagement was lower for students who were observed later in the semester and who had the most prior gaming experience.

Grade 4 student participants were taught using a blended learning instruction involving face-to-face sessions and electronic module (eModule) designed by the teacher using the Understanding by Design Framework. The electronic modules consisted of interactive applications (e.g., simulations, videos, games, worksheets, online readings, and online quizzes), which involved the use of mobile learning devices. In this study, interactive applications allow for back and forth interaction between students and the computer programs. A quasi-experimental research design was employed to determine how these interactive applications facilitate in developing students’ scientific reasoning skills. These skills were determined by students’ performance in a 23-item Knowledge and Technical Skills Test (KTST) and a 35-item Process Skills Test (PST) on Plant Propagation developed by the researchers. Paired t-test was used to determine differences in the students’ pretest and posttest performances on the KTST and on the PST. Results revealed significant differences between pretest and posttest where t(31)=−27.47, p < 0.0005 in the KTST and t(31)=−31.42, p <0.0005 in the PST. These results are suggestive that the use of interactive applications in the eModule facilitated the development of the students’ knowledge and technical skills (KTS) and the process skills (PS) in learning Plant Propagation. Interestingly, the process skills domain has a higher mean gain score compare with knowledge and technical skills. Results of the study underscores that a well-designed electronic module using varied interactive applications facilitate the development of the students’ scientific skills in understanding science concepts. © 2015 American Scientific Publishers.","Blended learning; eModules; Interactive applications; Knowledge and technical skills; Process skills","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84946899550"

In the past few years, strategies have been generated to optimize the use of technological resources with the aim of facilitating widespread adoption of technology in the classroom. Given its low acquisition and maintenance costs, the interpersonal computer allows individual interaction and simultaneous learning with large groups of students. The purpose of this work was to compare arithmetical knowledge acquired by third-grade students through the use of game-based activities and non-game-based activities using an interpersonal computer, with knowledge acquired through the use of traditional paper-and-pencil activities, and to analyze their impact in various socio-cultural contexts. To do this, a quasi-experimental study was conducted with 271 students in three different countries (Brazil, Chile, and Costa Rica), in both rural and urban schools. A set of educational games for practising arithmetic was developed and tested in six schools within these three countries. Results show that there were no significant differences (ANCOVA) in the learning acquired from game-based vs. non-game-based activities. However, both showed a significant difference when compared with the traditional method. Additionally, both groups using the interpersonal computer showed higher levels of student interest than the traditional method group, and these technological methods were seen to be especially effective in increasing learning among weaker students. © International Forum of Educational Technology & Society (IFETS).","Arithmetic practice; Cross-cultural projects; Educational games; Intelligent tutoring systems; Interpersonal computer; Shared display","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84907301471"

Most stimuli used in vigilance research over the previous six decades have been relatively simple and often purport to represent important aspects of detection and discrimination tasks in real-world settings. Such displays are most frequently composed of single stimulus presentations in discrete trials against a uniform, often uncluttered background. The present experiment establishes a dynamic, first-person perspective vigilance task in motion using a video-game environment. 'Vigilance on the move' is thus a new paradigm for the study of sustained attention. We conclude that the stress of vigilance extends to the new paradigm, but whether the performance decrement emerges depends upon specific task parameters. The development of the task, the issues to be resolved and the pattern of performance, perceived workload and stress associated with performing such dynamic vigilance are reported.Practitioner Summary: The present experiment establishes a dynamic, first-person perspective movement-based vigilance task using a video-game environment.

Children of today may grow up never knowing a time when movies, television and video games were not available stereoscopically. Despite this rapid expansion, the field’s understanding of the impact of stereoscopic visualizations on learning is rather limited. Much of the excitement of stereoscopic technology could be due to a novelty effect, which will wear off over time. This study controlled for the novelty factor using a variety of techniques. On the floor of an urban science center, 261 children were shown 12 photographs and visualizations of highly spatial scientific objects and scenes. The images were randomly shown in either traditional (2D) format or in stereoscopic format. The children were asked two questions of each image—one about a spatial property of the image and one about a real-world application of that property. At the end of the test, the child was asked to draw from memory the last image they saw. Results showed no overall significant difference in response to the questions associated with 2D or 3D images. However, children who saw the final slide only in 3D drew more complex representations of the slide than those who did not. Results are discussed through the lenses of cognitive load theory and the effect of novelty on engagement. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","3D; Informal learning; Science education; Spatial cognition; Stereoscopy; Visualizations","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84911999457"

The process was mediated by participants’ general perspective-taking and sympathy abilities, which relate to the cognitive and affective routes to learning. Structural equation modeling was used to examine the process. One hundred and forty-five girls between the ages of 7 and 15 completed the self-report online survey. Findings suggest that prosocial gaming is associated with greater perspective-taking and sympathizing abilities. These abilities positively correlated with thoughts about all types of violence as wrong whether or not “justified” and independent of severity. Error correlations suggest that younger girls’ processing comprises an affective component that bypasses the cognitive or perspective-taking route. Findings also intimate that in the case of justified violence assessments, girls not only evaluated the aggressor’s violent act but also assessed what precipitated the act thus suggesting more complex thought. © The Author(s) 2012.","General Learning Model; perspective-taking; prosocial video games; sympathy; violence","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84907095230"

The adaptation concerns mainly the topic variety and the knowledge deepness. In the first part we discuss the origins of the storytelling approach, its interest in mediation tasks; we also handle the problem of transformation of some narrative functions into operational categories of analysis by means of adequate metadata. In the second part, we give some elements of the knowledge organization underlying such a system and precise the notions of learning profile and of point of view, for a case study concerning a video-based presentation of a Renaissance painting; in our case, we distinguish three profiles and nine points of view. We then give some examples illustrating the capacity of the system to build abundant adapted stories about the chosen painting; we also argue in favour of the local-ontology construction, which supports the whole system, both at the back- and the front-office levels. We finally conclude with some educational enhancements we currently develop (storytelling generalization containing complementary mediation modes, as Problem Resolution and Serious Games, integration of stereoscopic 3D videos, intelligent track of an end-user during her/his reading process as well as customized contextual assistance to her/him reading goal). © 2014 MAA Printed in Greece.

Thus, identity is viewed as co-constructed, within a social-constructionist perspective on learning. The study is two-folded. It starts out by describing how participants in a Finland-Swedish preschool setting orient to ethnic identity in everyday interactions. Video recordings are analyzed using conversation analysis, a relatively recent approach to the exploration of how ethnicity is accomplished in interaction. It shows that the different ethnic backgrounds of the children were considerably more prominent in the informal self-initiated interactions between themselves than in situations where adults were present. The children mainly used ethnicity as a resource to investigate themselves in relation to others to negotiate status and construct in- and out-groups. The second part focuses on how to create a more inclusive school-setting by more actively supporting students' ethnic identity construction. It discusses the experiences from a teacher-researcher collaboration, where the way children constructed ethnic identity in the first part of the study was taken as the starting-point for the development of new practices. The study suggests the ongoing ethnic identity construction in everyday educational settings to be a fertile area for further research. We need to know more about how these processes can be supported in a manner that is sensitive to the students' needs to decide for themselves whether, and how, they wish to orient to their own ethnic backgrounds. © 2013 British Educational Research Association.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84902517466"

Method: Study participants included a cross-sectional sample of 4-, 5-, and 6-year-old children with typical cognitive and language development. The 66 participants were randomly assigned to either a deductive or inductive teaching condition in which they were taught a novel gender morphological inflection across 4 sessions. Learning was assessed on the basis of performance on learning, generalization, and maintenance probes. Results: Across all age groups, children were more likely to successfully use the novel gender form when taught using the deductive procedure than if taught using the inductive procedure (Φ range:.33-.73). Analyses within each age group revealed a robust effect for the 5-year-old children, with less consistent effects across the other age groups. Conclusions: Study results suggest that 4- to 6-year-old children with typical language and cognitive abilities are able to make use of a deductive language teaching procedure when learning a novel gender inflection. Evidence also suggests that this effect is driven by expressive and receptive language ability. © American Speech-Language-Hearing Association.","","Child; Child Development; Child Language; Child, Preschool; Female; Generalization (Psychology); Helplessness, Learned; Humans; Intelligence; Language Development; Language Development Disorders; Linguistics; Logic; Male; Phonetics; Problem Solving; Reference Values; Video Games; child; child development; female; human; intelligence; language development; Language Development Disorders; learned helplessness; learning; linguistics; logic; male; phonetics; preschool child; problem solving; procedures; recreation; reference value","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84900017447"

Thus, increasing learning motive by game-based learning becomes a common instructional strategy to enhance learning achievement. However, it is not easy to design interesting games combined with courses. In 2011, Echeverria proposed a design to combine characteristics of games with elements of courses by matching the virtual scenarios in games with proper courses. However, in the past game-based learning, students were gathered in regular places for several times of game-based learning. Students' learning was limited by time and space. Therefore, for students' game-based learning at any time and in any places, based on theories of design elements of online community game Aki Järvinen, this study treats Facebook as the platform of games. The development by online community game is easier, faster and cheaper than traditional video games. In 2006, Facebook allowed API program of the third party. Therefore, by Facebook, this study provides the platform for students to learn in social lives to explore students' activities in online community games. Questionnaire survey is conducted to find out if the design of non-single user game is attractive for students to participate in game-based learning. In order to make sure that the questionnaires can be the criteria to investigate students' intention to play games, by statistical program of social science; this study validates reliability and validity of items of questionnaire to effectively control the effect of online community games on students' learning intention.","Facebook; Game-based learning; Social network game","Curricula; Human computer interaction; Online systems; Social networking (online); Students; Surveys; Facebook; Game-based Learning; Instructional strategy; On-line communities; Questionnaire surveys; Reliability and validity; Social network games; Virtual scenario; Education computing","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84903958721"

Meanwhile, teaching about evolution is never an easy task due to the existence of some barriers to its learning. Virtual Age, therefore, has been developed in an attempt to harness the power of gaming to increase student understanding of biological evolution. The aim of this study was to examine whether Virtual Age is effective for learning about evolution and to further explore the interplay of student concept learning, gaming performance, and in-game behaviors. A total of 62 7th graders took part in the study, and significant findings were revealed. The students did learn by playing Virtual Age, and their long-term knowledge retention was promising. The in-game behaviors, such as times and duration of viewing the relevant information embedded in Virtual Age, were significantly related to gaming performance (game score), which subsequently influenced learning outcomes. Moreover, the results of cluster analysis indicated that three clusters of low learning outcomes/low gaming performance, high learning outcomes, and high gaming performance emerged. Overall, Virtual Age is an effective game for learning about evolution based on its sound and sophisticated design. Implications derived from the study and suggestions for future work are proposed. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.All rights reserved.","Applications in subject areas; Interactive learning environments; Secondary education; Teaching/learning strategies; Virtual reality","Biology; Cluster analysis; Computer aided instruction; Human computer interaction; Interactive computer graphics; Students; Virtual reality; Applications in subject areas; Biological evolution; Concept learning; Interactive learning environment; Knowledge retention; Learning outcome; Teaching/learning strategy; Unique features; E-learning","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84925664572"

Allegedly the reason of this problem laid in contextual factors and learner’s considerations including the instrument, medium and also appropriate techniques for instruction. To address this problem, video games were applied for one of the basic steps of language learning and literacy skill for specific age group of 14-16 students i.e. spelling. In this study 40 students from two classes were randomly divided into two groups, control and experimental (each 20). The pre-test was done in one session. After that, the experimental group received the treatment subjecting to original computer games, but the control group received a placebo. The classroom was equipped with the computer, television, overhead projector, etc. Each week was spent on one game. At the end of each session, the students were required to play the game and elicit words and spelling of them. After eight sessions of treatment, through different kinds of video computer games, the results of the study showed that the experimental group outperformed the control group in posttest and delayed posttest.

This study aims to construct a collaborative and competitive game-based learning environment to improve English proficiencies and reduce the achievement gap for disadvantaged students. The Wireless Crossword Fan-Tan Game (WiCFG) system was implemented to provide teachers with an innovative approach to guide students’ learning through a positive involvement with the uses of tablet PCs. The experiment was conducted in an elementary school in Taiwan to investigate whether this approach would facilitate students’ learning effectiveness and interactions. Thirty sixth-grade students were randomly assigned into a control group and an experimental group. Both qualitative and quantitative data were collected from surveys, interviews, observations and video-recordings. The results indicate that integration of the WiCFG system in the collaborative and competitive game-based learning environment leads students to a better interaction between different levels of students.

Findings indicate that video games and supplemental text were effective at providing students with multiple means of representation and expression. The UDL-aligned units led to heightened levels of student engagement. There were no significant differences on posttest scores when students with LD were compared with peers without LD. Students' performance did not indicate significant differences between UDL-aligned units and those taught using traditional curricular materials.

Improving FMS proficiency is a priority given its association with physical activity. This study aimed to identify children's and parents' perceptions of: (1) AVGs as a tool for developing FMS and (2) whether any skills gained during AVG play had potential to transfer to real life. Methods: This qualitative descriptive study included 29 parents of children aged 9-10 years who participated in semi-structured telephone interviews and 34 children who participated in six group discussions at school. Interview and discussion group data were recorded, transcribed and analysed thematically. Results: Parents and children had different perspectives on the potential of AVGs for FMS, which largely rested on different views of 'reality'. Parents felt AVGs were not a substitute for the 'real thing', and therefore had limited FMS benefits. Overall, parents thought any FMS gained through AVGs would have poor transferability to 'real life'. In contrast, children had a more fluid and expansive view of reality which incorporated both 'real life' and 'virtual' space. Whilst children could articulate limitations of AVGs for skill learning, they still reported extensive use of AVGs as a learning tool for movement skill, and considered that skill acquisition was highly transferable. Conclusions: Despite contrasting beliefs from parents and children, children used AVGs for FMS learning. Future research needs to determine whether actual FMS benefits are gained through AVGs. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","electronic games; focus groups; fundamental movement skill; interviews; physical activity; sport","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84904393984"

A partial solution is to develop computer-based teaching modules that take advantage of animation, web-based or off-campus learning experiences directed at engaging students' creative experiences. We used the learning objectives of one of the most difficult topics in food chemistry, enzyme kinetics, to test this concept. Students are apprehensive of this subject and often criticize the staid instructional methods typically used in teaching this material. As a result, students do not acquire a useful background in this important subject. To rectify these issues, we developed an interactive augmented reality application to teach the basic concepts of enzyme kinetics in the context of an interactive search that took students to several locations on campus where they were able to gather raw materials and view videos that taught the basics of enzyme kinetics as applied to the production of high fructose corn syrup (HFCS). The students needed this background to prepare for a mock interview with an HFCS manufacturer. Students and instructors alike found the game to be preferable to sitting in a classroom listening to, or giving, a PowerPoint presentation. We feel that this use of gaming technology to teach difficult, abstract concepts may be a breakthrough in food science education and help alleviate the drain on administrative budgets from multiple wet labs. © 2015 Institute of Food Technologists®.","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84920887643"

Intergenerational learning (IGL) involves knowledge building, innovation and knowledge transfer between generations within an organization (Ropes 2011). Serious games refer to the use of computer games in raising awareness about educational topics, acquiring new knowledge and skills by enabling learners to engage and participate in situations that would otherwise be impossible to experience (Corti 2006). Although learning with the use of serious games is similar to traditional learning in several cognitive respects, there are noted differences in the learning style and structure of learning using serious games. The success of learning using serious games lies in the actual involvement of a participant playing the game, which in turn, creates increased cognitive links with real-life situations allowing the individual to make relevant associations, to use mnemonic strategies with the facilitation of multi-dimensional educational aids (e.g., visual, auditory). Some of the beneficial aspects of learning with the use of serious games include the elevation of several cognitive skills, which are directly or indirectly implicated in the learning process. Among them are attention and visuo-spatial abilities, memory and motor skills. However, several barriers have been noted that fall into two general categories: a) health issues (e.g., cognitive strain, headaches) and b) psychological issues (e.g., social isolation, emotional disturbances). Since the training conditions are learner-centered and highly determined by the individual, there is increased need for evaluating the learning outcomes using specific success indicators. Examples of games that are designed to facilitate IGL are scarce, while there are no examples of IGL games in most EU countries. The purpose of this paper is to critically evaluate the current literature of theories on learning through serious games in adults and the elderly with reference to the cognitive mechanisms implicated, benefits and barriers in learning using new technologies in different generations. Secondly, this paper reviews the existence of serious games designed to facilitate IGL in Europe, as well as the characteristics of serious games in raising awareness that could be used to facilitate IGL. In doing so, specific focus is placed on the development of success indicators that determine the effectiveness of serious games on raising awareness on IGL. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Aging; Innovation; Intergenerational learning; Knowledge transfer; Older workers; Organizations; Serious games","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84904384836"

This occurs in interactive, video, audio, and textual media alike. Immersive game environments intensify this process, as James Gee states in 2003, but intrinsic learning has taken place in board games, and according to Mary Flanagan this dates back at least to 1250. On top of this, games are currently beginning to assert themselves as works of art. Considering game designers as artists raises the bar for creative responsibility. The goal of this article is to further an understanding of the role of the game designer as moral teacher and artist by studying an intersection of ethics and games.

The results showed that the two instruments were both mainly applied at the final stage of Junior School and the initial stage of Secondary School. The GPAI was used chiefly in PE (90.91%), through hetero-assessment (90.91%), observation of videos (90.91%), and at the beginning and the end of the teaching and learning process (54.54%). The TSAP was more likely than the GPAI to be used in youth sports (40%), through peer-assessment (60%), live (real time) assessment (60%), and at the end of the teaching–learning process (80%). Despite the possibilities provided by their excellent design, the present review shows that neither instrument has been used very frequently, according to the analysed variables. © The Author(s) 2014.","assessment; decision-making; tactics; Teaching games for understanding","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84912034117"

Previous research suggests that many media sources, including television programs and popular movies, display risky behaviors and a general disregard for safety. The present study added to this literature by quantifying the extent to which a popular form of media, video games, displays injury events and appropriate utilization of safety gear. Research assistants coded trailers of the world's most popular video games across 13 different genres. Acceptable reliability estimates across assistants were obtained, and results revealed that many video games do not portray safety restraint devices, helmets, or other safety gear. Less than 3% of games show primary characters wearing safety restraint devices while they are driving a vehicle, and helmets are rarely displayed when characters ride bicycles or skateboards. Significant differences in the portrayal of injury events and safety gear usage emerged across Entertainment Software Rating Board ratings.

The learning process, a very important feature of intelligent methods, is the result of an intelligent game controller to determine and control the game objects behaviors' or actions autonomously. Our approach is to use a more efficient learning model in the form of artificial neural networks for training the controllers. We propose a Hill-Climbing Neural Network (HillClimbNet) that controls the movement of the Ms. Pac-man agent to travel around the maze, gobble all of the pills and escape from the ghosts in the maze. HillClimbNet combines the hill-climbing strategy with a simple, feed-forward artificial neural network architecture. The aim of this study is to analyze the performance of various activation functions for the purpose of generating neural-based controllers to play a video game. Each non-linear activation function is applied identically for all the nodes in the network, namely log-sigmoid, logarithmic, hyperbolic tangent-sigmoid and Gaussian. In general, the results shows an optimum configuration is achieved by using log-sigmoid, while Gaussian is the worst activation function.©Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2011.","Artificial neural networks; Computational intelligence in games; Gaussian; Hill-climbing; Hyperbolic tangent-sigmoid; Log-sigmoid; Logarithmic; Ms. Pac-Man","Gaussian distribution; Human computer interaction; Hyperbolic functions; Network architecture; Neural networks; Pelletizing; Radioactivity logging; Gaussians; Hill climbing; Hyperbolic tangent-sigmoid; Log-sigmoid; Logarithmic; Pac-man; Controllers","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84893022545"

On basis of reviewing past studies, and their research issues, this study has suggested a distinctive conceptual model that has been proposed from traits theory of personality and engagement theory, particularly by taking the dimensions of HEXACO personality inventory model and one of the essences of engagement theory (learning through getting exposure of digital-framework) like video-game engagement as moderating variable. This paper has come up with the study propositions, which further requires future work to investigate them empirically. This study is unique in marketing to contribute in the field of consumer behavior by investigating the role of hedonic product as “video game” and its consumption as “engagement” and examining its moderating influence on consumers’ personality. © 2015 American Scientific Publishers.

One part of this effort should be to increase understanding of how video games can be situated within teachers' existing goals and knowledge of learning and instruction. However, relatively little research on game-based learning addresses teachers (Ketelhut & Schifter, 2011), and for many a gap remains between the apparent enthusiasm of researchers and policy makers relative to the potential of educational games and the attendant practicalities of selecting and implementing video games in classroom settings. This article begins to bridge this gap by providing research-based areas of awareness and a discussion of factors that can facilitate understanding related to choosing and using video games. To this end, we show how educational games can be conceptualized from different theoretical perspectives on learning and discuss a number of essential design issues that educators should take into account when considering a video game for educational use. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","assessment mechanics; design issues; game-based learning; learning mechanics; video games","Interactive computer graphics; Learning systems; Research; Teaching; Classroom settings; Design issues; Educational benefits; Educational game; Educational use; Game-based Learning; Games for learning; Video game; Human computer interaction","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84898929165"

Learning is important for stability and success. It would seem rational that students in groups that are frequently underrepresented or marginalized would be motivated to learn. However, negotiation of multiple identities and self-beliefs can impact motivations to learn. For example, young African American males frequently adopt a ""cool pose"" in their approach to education. They maintain that they do not care and will not try to be a part of the existing educational system. To better understand these issues, we studied African American males in the Glitch Game Testers program. High school students in the Glitch program worked as paid game testers and took workshops in computer science. More than 65% of the participants went on to study computing after high school. We found that these students persisted with education and computing because they navigated around motivations to not learn by creating many different faces for their involvement with Glitch. In this article, we explore the use and design implications of face-saving tactics these young men used to ""geek out"" on computer programming, choose computer science for their career, and maintain their current identities with friends and families.

The participants of this phenomenological study included 193 sophomores taking the ""Principles and Methods of Teaching"" course at Ahmet Keleşoǧlu Education Faculty, Necmettin Erbakan University, in the fall of the 2011-2012 academic year. Data were gathered from the compositions written by the participants by using two open-ended prompts (""For me, learning was like ... because ..."" and ""To me, learning is/should be like ... because ..."") and analyzed using the content analysis technique. According to the findings of the study, participants conceptualized their experienced learning with 18 metaphorical images and ideal learning with 25 metaphorical images. The three categories and some of the corresponding metaphors representing the participants' experienced learning include the following: (1) ""learning as an involuntary/compulsory activity"" (racing in the marathon), (2) ""learning as memorization/ accumulation of knowledge"" (recording with a video camera), and (3) ""learning as a temporary/momentary activity"" (putting makeup on). The six categories and some of the corresponding metaphors representing the participants' ideal learning include the following: (1) ""learning as exploring"" (traveling to a mysterious place), (2) ""learning as active participation"" (bees making honey), (3) ""learning as meaning making"" (putting together the pieces of a puzzle), (4) ""learning as schema generation"" (recharging the brain), (5) ""learning as a social process"" (playing games with friends), and (6) ""learning as self-actualization"" (learning how to catch fish). While participants associated their experienced learning with more negative metaphorical images and more features of surface learning (knowledge increase, memorization), they paralleled their ideal learning with more positive metaphorical images and more features of deep learning (meaning making, self-actualization). In addition, the experienced and ideal learning conceptions gathered from the participation and views of only one education faculty's pre-service teachers need to be validated by the views of more teacher candidates studying at other teacher training institutions. © 2014 Educational Consultancy and Research Center.","Conceptions of learning; Metaphorical image; Phenomenology; Prospective primary teacher; Qualitative research","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84904597383"

The aim of the course was to learn how to design computer games and programming skills by creating their own games, thereby applying their game-playing experiences to gain knowledge about game design. The aim was for students to develop a more critically reflective perspective on video games and game design. In applying their game experiences, they developed their own digital prototypes and participated in reflective discussions on the concept of games: what makes them interesting and how they are constructed. The students used the GameMaker programming tool, which can be used without any prior programming knowledge. The tool allows for the easy development of 2D game prototypes.The didactic approach was based on play as a lever for the design process, and on constructionistic and reflective learning philosophies. Playing games constituted an integral element of the design process; new code added to the program was tested by playing the game. The students were constantly alternating between playing and adding and revising code. The learning environment where games were played and developed could be considered to be a sandbox where experimentation was a motivational factor for the students, as they could make mistakes and try out creative ideas. Although the constructionistic learning approach promoted creative and innovative learning, it did not develop competencies in articulation and analysis. The aim was for students to reflect on games in order to promote explicit knowledge. Based on the theory, we consider retrospective reflective discussions in the classroom and their programming experiences reinforced the learning process. In summary, we present the students' first progression from native consumers in the game world to becoming reflective designers. Along their journey, they developed a reflective practice and an understanding of the profession they were entering. The article also throws light on the very dynamic and fruitful relationship that exists between playing games and designing games. © ACPIL.","Constructionism; Game design; Game-based learning; Learning; Play; Reflection; Serious games; University pedagogy","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84904038070"

The participants took part in classes on the use of video games console PlayStation 3. 57 senior (over 60 years of age) learners took part in the study. They have been randomly assigned to control and experimental groups. The control group took part in traditional classes and the experiment group took part in locationbased game. The aim of the study was to answer the research question: Does the learning of information and communications technologies by seniors with the use of location-based game improve the quality of learning (indicated by the time of realising the task, number of questions asked during the realisation of the task, seniors’ evaluation of the technology, of the classes and of their own competences)? Seniors evaluated the classes, the technology and their own competences by means of original questionnaire consisting of grading attractiveness, usefulness and difficulty of the class and the technology, and grading their own ability to use the technology, the want to use the technology and the recommendation of the technology to others. As the results of the experiment indicate the learning of information and communications technologies by seniors with the use of location-based game improves the quality of their learning. The use of location-based game increases significantly the pace of assimilation of the knowledge by the learners as indicated by the time of realising the task. It also increases the level of self-reliability of the learners as indicated by the number of questions asked during the realisation of the task. However, it does not affect learners’ perception of the technology, the classes and their own competences as is indicated by the evaluation. © 2014, Mediterranean Center of Social and Educational Research.
